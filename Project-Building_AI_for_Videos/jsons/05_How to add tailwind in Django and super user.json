Welcome to Chai and Code And the best part is Thank you so much for all the comments And back to back comments You have kept the motivation at the peak And that's why we are doing so much So welcome to Chai and Django This video is a part of our Django series We bring a lot of series on our channel We don't just make Gyan Roadmap We like to make series, complete projects And full courses So that's what we do If you are new to our channel, please subscribe If you are old, then our target for this video is 350 comments Please do it within 24 hours It's a lot of fun I read all the comments I scroll comments more than Reels Let's move on What we will do in this video We will elevate Django a little bit Because dumping things suddenly Is not a solution It's not a way to teach The way to teach is to have fun So let's learn new things We will learn two new things First, how to use Tailwind CSS In Django And second is an admin panel As soon as the admin panel comes You will get to know about the power Why are there so many fans of Django So we will come to that too That is a small task, admin panel It doesn't even take 2 minutes The problem is in Tailwind And often in Django courses Tailwind is not included In fact, you will see paid courses It is not taught there And it's not their fault Because the setup is a little complicated And often with Django Front end development is less Basically, you can inject bootstrap Or take material UI But you know We raise the level So we will go to Tailwind And it's not easy Because the installation instructions Are a little muddy on the website So if you have any questions You can see in the comment section The whole article is step by step So that you can come again It's good if you watch the video Our views will only increase But in case you have to see a few things You can see from that article There is nothing wrong with that I won't agree So let's go to you first How to install Tailwind In Python, there are many packages Like in Node, there are thousands of packages One package is useful for us That is Django Tailwind Now this package Works very well But the installation is not so easy The second problem is This pip We are still using uv Uv is no doubt in Rust It is very ridiculously fast But I have not seen uv on production And in fact When you bring third party packages There is a lot of uv issue So this package is not 100% compatible It is a new package So we will see We have made our virtual environment From uv Now uv does not have pip directly If you have made the virtual environment from python Then it is fine But we will also come here And we will install pip in this In our current virtual environment So that we have uv and pip We will try to go ahead with pip So that stability is maintained So let's come here This is our vs code Which happens every time By the way, tell me in the comment section Have you commented or not First of all, you have to activate the virtual environment So let's do ls You have chai and django And here is my virtual environment So first of all, because I am on mac I have told you a different command If you do not remember Then go to our blog article It is very easy So I have to go to .venv There is a bin and a file Activate Now my Virtual environment is activated Now after the virtual environment is activated Yes, it is a little hot My throat is dry So our virtual environment is activated This is a small sign that yes Our virtual environment is activated Now I want to install it Now see this problem Let's see it in front of you We were doing uv and pip install We were doing it this way It was happening very easily But here as we run it Now it is running I think my first issue was happening But if it has been installed, then it is not a good thing Okay, maybe I did something wrong I will update in the documentation That we have it Now we will install one more package Now see that other package It does not have any requirement But you will like it very much Because in tailwind We want that as soon as I save If I write anything in the template, it will automatically Upload on the website There is no such thing as hot reload There are different packages in django But we take it with this So that our work becomes easy We have to do some configuration So what do we do for that Tailwind You get one more package with it But for that, first put it in quotes After that, put a square bracket here And you have to write reload Close the square bracket After that put an exclamation mark This is important As soon as you enter Now see here is a small problem Audited one package This was not required That's why I said that uv was giving me problems And this is the problem We have to install that package in actually Otherwise issues will come So the thing is that this is done But tell me the solution to the problem Now the solution to the problem is You have to install pip I will tell you two commands to install pip One of the two will definitely work for you It depends on where you are In which system So I will tell you First after python Dash m and after that there is a command Ensure pip So as soon as you give the command After that write dash dash upgrade Will give this command So 70-80% Chances are that your install will be done If you do not install Pip Then there is another command which Almost 100% works So that command is very simple After that take pip and install it That's it And we also upgrade it by hand Here take upgrade And pip So with this we should have pip installed Python dash m I am not able to do it with this command So I will go to the previous command Now it will depend on which command you are So we go to ensure pip And dash dash upgrade So that's why I told you both the commands Because see what happens many times There are edge cases and rely on one command If it is not working then I check it on multiple test cases These commands That's why I take more time in making Courses and videos Because I verify all this personally That's why I take some time I tell you different scenarios So that you can do it well in production Now see we have pip installed So now the package I was installing Now I can do it directly So see UV is not working So we remove this UV and directly pip install Now I can pip install in my virtual environment And also UV See UV was cutting edge So I used it But yes in production pip is used So now enter it And I think still we have an issue Command not found pip It should not have come Ok Ok setup tool Requirement already satisfied You have pip in virtual environment It should not have happened This kind of issues Pip install Let's see more Dash dash upgrade Pip It should have worked Let's see I think now we have Sometimes I had to run both the commands Because there are many dependencies in the system We also keep on messing with virtual environment Let's try again I will not avoid or edit these things So that you also see what is the struggle How it happens many times Let's see pip install django And hopefully now it is installed You also saw There was a little struggle But it is important to see That's why I wrote both the commands You will get both the commands in the blog Now we have pip installed We have seen shortcomings of UV And we have django tailwind And django tailwind reload Both are installed Now what we have to do We have to follow the instructions Through those instructions Their procedure And the order is very important You can't do it separately First of all I have to go to my main app Where I will get settings.py In this settings.py I have to add an app I have installed apps We have made a chai app And one more app I will turn off the suggestions Now the app you have Is tailwind Save it Now as soon as you save it We have to run a command It is a very basic command We are not getting python and manage.py So we will cd And tell python Please run manage.py But how to run You have to start tailwind So you have to give tailwind init command As soon as you give tailwind init command Some packages will be downloaded It takes some time to download these packages But at last you will be asked What name you want to give your app You can choose any name You like I go to default We will keep theme Now what happened You have a new folder You can see it I don't have any option to zoom But you have What option But it will hide behind me But you will know that theme is here Now because you have theme You have to install one more app I have a theme So you have to install it And tell it that theme app is here Ok You have to do some more work You have the theme app But you have to write some more configuration By the way You will get all this in the documentation And in the article description I have written easy documentation So that you can get used to reading So after that You have to do some small settings You have to tell your app name Tailwind App name Now how will you tell the name Whatever name you have I have kept theme You have kept superman You have kept nagraj After that you have to give one more thing You don't need the rest of the app But because we are going to run two servers So we have to tell What is our internal IP So we get an option here And in this We tell What is our internal IP So we know 127.0.0.1 Here you go So these are the arrays You can write it But remember the spellings This is internal IP And this is IPs So you have to enter IPs This is the first string If you have any other domain If you are working in production If you have any domain Then you can add it Ok This work is done Now what to do You have to add this It won't work without this Now we have to install Tailwind Now your app is here The biggest feature of Django Is that you have Everything in the folder I have to install it Initialize it So we go here and install it How to install it It is very easy Call manage.py And install it That's it It takes some time Especially when you are recording It takes more time Because I use a lot of resources During recording So it will be fast for you If you are on good internet Ok Package is installed Now You can use Tailwind There are some small issues I will tell you Because of that, the documentation was a little weird Ok Now if you open this theme We have a folder called templates And we have base.html In base.html You will see only two new things Load static Tailwind tags And Tailwind CSS They have given A base template Like we made a layout Some people call it base It's the same And If you want to inject Tailwind Or inject it anywhere You can add it because of these two lines Line 1 and line 9 Because we already have our base template I want to add it to my base template So I have this layout.html I go to the top and load static I add it from here So I have Tailwind tags added And one more line Tailwind CSS Copy it and add it here I add it under the style sheet You can also do it above Ok Hopefully I have all this Now I want to run the server And see if I have work or not If I have work then how For that also We will need some things I want to introduce you to errors We will get errors Let's see the errors I have errors here And errors will come First through python And basic command is run server Ok, we handle run server So I want to open this port Ok, we open the port We are here Alright Everything is running No problem Errors will come Don't worry Now what I want to do Remove all the files Now I know that in layout.html Technically I can write Tailwind Ok If Tailwind is included here Then you will think that I can write it in index.html Yes, technically you should write it First of all I have a problem Class And I want Tailwind classes So I said bg-orange Orange And 400, 500 I am getting suggestions from Tailwind Intellisense In case you don't have it Then tell me the solution We tell all the solutions And let's make it large So text-3xl Let's see It's not working Let's reload So it's clear that we don't have background color Why? Because it's not generated To generate it You need one more terminal Let's start one more terminal And We can do it in virtual environment We can do it in virtual environment But We can't do it in virtual environment So let's turn it on Same simple source And after source I think I need to go to folder And after that Source And .venv I think ls-la I think I came to wrong directory I need to go to one directory ls So wherever your source is .venv And activate This virtual environment is also activated I will rename it And you also use these techniques Otherwise you will also get confused So I will call this terminal Tailwind And you can also give it color So change color And we give it green So I will know that Tailwind terminals have Increased productivity So I use it Now my server is running Now I need to start tailwind So I need to call it Python And manage.py So let's go to manage.py So python Manage.py And tailwind start So Tailwind is continuously Building And we need it So let's reload Still not Why not Because in this condition You need to restart And you may see some errors So let's close it And restart So I think now tailwind is generating So There were errors But now there are no errors Maybe you are using Environment variables But you will get 100% errors There is no exception So what errors are we talking about We need to go to settings And After coming here You need to add one path Without that it will not work That is npm bin path So we need to come here And say npm Underscore bin underscore path Now how can you give npm bin path First you need to search To search Open a terminal Any terminal you have I always have warp So open warp Whatever terminal you have You can run a simple command here So when you give it You will get where it is For windows You will get two paths One like this And one like this So you will get here You need that path So pick it up Copy it Now what is the problem Because to run tailwind Actually you need npm By the way, you need to install node You are on my channel If you are on windows I have given you a command Because what is the problem in windows In windows you will have this string But it will be like this Forward slash This forward slash Is a nightmare Not only this Program space files Now files and space This is also a nightmare If you have not come to linux system Then you will know how big nightmare Forward slashes and this So what will people do That such strings and such paths Are not there on the system So what we do there We have raw string And we replace them In double quotes So that if there is anything So I have given you that in documentation So take care of it That yes, there is such a file And these forward slashes Whatever you have I will comment it for now That it was only for windows users So let's give it For windows users And I will comment it too It is not necessary for me I am on mac If you are on windows then come to linux Till when will you stay Now what will happen In case if you have Tailwind is not running Because tailwind is node based It generates everything from node So now I think it will be easy for you In case if you are getting an error So your error will be solved So stop it once and start it again By the way, do not worry When you go to production You have to write Simple here That you want to build it So build will be done and production grade will come to you So don't worry about the experience It is not that I will tell you only half I will tell you the whole thing Now you have done so much work And now I go to index If I make it blue So hopefully we are getting changes But still I have to go and reload Now what we do See we have installed hot reloading So now we make hot reloading Accessible Or configure settings So close everything And see how it will be done Close everything once Now let's go to our chai and django Settings.py Because all the work will be done from here And after this we have one more app Which we have installed So we put a comma here and bring this app This is django browser reload Yes this is the name of this app But install is the same By putting square brackets It has already been given to you in the documentation Now not only this In another documentation You have been given a small middleware Now see we have not touched middleware much yet Obviously we will touch it later But in this too you have to go to the end And keep it at the end So we add one more here Which is our simple django browser reload .middleware.browser reload middleware Yes it is very big And see these settings no one will write These settings are usually copy pasted Either on documentation If you have a blog article then copy paste it from there Everyone keeps these settings Ok this is done There is one more small thing What is the final one You have to go to urls.py Which url? Project one Here you have to enable one more path at the end Always keep this path at the end Always keep this path at the end This is the path which actually Reloads the auto So keep this at the end Because it sends gzip So this is a heavy path Because now you need hot reload When you put it in production You will remove it There it is built So it never comes to use So don't worry about it Whenever you make any other path or app Keep it at the end Now we need Restart everything There is no option for that This also needs to be restarted And this is a common mistake You have to restart Now we have technically Like you are in blue Now I can close all this And then we can go to Our templates Index.html Close it Now if I come to red So hopefully we have red 500 And it should have come On auto reload But for some reason it should have Orange Now hot reload has started Sometimes it takes 1-2 seconds But hot reload stays And after this if we come Text3.xl What else can we do? Suppose there is a paragraph In which there is a lorem Suppose there are 10 words And we add a class on it And we write the class Text Dash center Width Dash How much should we give? 5rem is enough And we give bg Bg dash orange 400 Yes, our hot reload is working Although we did not intend to give it But we got to know that Hot reload is working Ok, a lot of work is done A lot of work But ok Whatever you were learning in Django Which you had to express Now once the tailwind has come So you can see all the skills you have learned In frontend You can bring all the skills here Copy paste, no problem Ok, this work is done Now let's close it Now let's go to our second work Which actually Makes Django powerful That is Django's own admin panel This kind of admin panel Comes in many other frameworks Like it comes in Laravel And Django's Admin panel is very famous I expected that in Javascript ecosystem Admin panels will come like this But eventually in future It is necessary Now this admin panel is highly configurable Don't look at it in the first look That it looks very old school It is kept old school So that it is the highest compatibility In all browsers And it is not like this You can modify it completely You can inject your own CSS You can do whatever you want In fact, the way we got tailwind Similarly, Django's templates are also available Admin templates They are much easier to configure You just have to inject it 1-2 settings change and that's it Your whole admin gets revamped And it talks directly to the model So you don't have to write any extra code You just have to write one line And whatever model you made You get the crud functionality Which we will see in the coming video So now let's go back And see how we can add it Or start it Now let's come here This is tailwind, let it run Now we come to our core error Which we have ignored so far Whenever we start running our command like this So I have told you to ignore one error You have 18 unapplied migrations The migrations They talk to your database Now we have an SQLite database But eventually there will be Postgres There will be MySQL You can put any database SQL, NoSQL, all work Now this 18 Tell me one thing, it is so much fun to read You are watching videos so busy It's not like a little tweet Comment, subscribe Listening very carefully But not this, taking a live class But not like this, let's share Anyway, let's talk about it sometime Here see 18 unapplied migrations Migration means In Django You never write SQL directly You never talk directly to the database Django's ORM talks on your behalf So to talk about it We have two commands Now we will read one command We will read the second command It is very basic, that command is directly Go to python Manage.py does all the work We will read one command now The first command is migrate As soon as you migrate All the due migrations They have migrated To start the admin panel You needed authentication You also needed admin If all those admins and tables are not there Then where will you log in So all those things are done Now when you run the command Run server You don't see any errors So we have talked about errors Now we come See hot reload is also running This work is also done Do we have admin now Yes, admin is there But there is a little more issue Now you can go directly to slash admin Why could I go to slash admin Because if you go and see In your project In urls.py You will see that it is already configured Which is admin slash And here admin site urls So something is pre-cooked for you You have been given admin Go to slash admin and you will have admin Not only that In settings.py, many more things are also given for you Which is databases Which we will talk about later There are also auth password validators Name, username, common password validators Minimum length of passwords You get these by default You don't have to worry much Although these validations Only super user can bypass But other users can't If you want to do it Configuration will be required But see how much work has already come for you By default There are many more things We will also discuss about them Now let's read a few more commands And then we stop it We have stopped it And cleaned it Now what we need I have to create a super user So come to python Tell manage.py To create a super user This is one word I type it many times Hopefully you haven't done it yet As soon as you enter super user First your username is asked Either your system will take default My system name is apple So I give it a name Hitesh No need to give email address You can leave the field empty Or you can leave it empty Password Now it is very annoying Hitesh chai Enter Hitesh chai Now it says the password is very similar Bypass it You find a good password I am keeping the password Hitesh chai I am keeping the password Hitesh chai For now I feel like it I will also do it You will keep the password Ok Now our super user is created Now the server should run Run server That's it Migrate and run a command Now let's come here Reload it Reload Now you need a username I have kept the username Hitesh Password is Hitesh chai And let's log in And here you have it Now you have the option of view site Change password You get all this by default Yes Change password and log out You also have theming Light mode, dark mode You can keep it as you like Not only this If you want you can also make users Go to home And here you have users and group There are many more things As soon as you click add You can make a new user Put the username, password, confirm password And click on save And you have a new user It will not be a root user But you can make it if you want If you have groups We have 0 groups You can make it by adding groups You can change the username Email address is empty Staff status Admin status There are many things We will configure it so much That you will feel We should not have done all this In any other language or framework That's why people use it We will see how we can integrate models But the most important thing For now is this And the most important thing for now Is to subscribe So subscribe I hope you are having fun in Django There are many settings in Django More than writing code We have to do many configurations Because the framework is already matured It gives you a lot of superpowers So this is our Tailwind CSS introduction We have also taken a little bit of authentication Admin dashboard Now we will see in the next video How we can make new models How we can perform new applications How we can take data from the database And send it to the frontend There are many things to do And we will do a lot But I hope you liked it You must have enjoyed it You have seen a lot of in-detail Documentation, third-party apps You have already seen a lot in 2-4 videos And often by doing this Or by making 1-2 to-do apps Courses end But it depends on how many comments you make We will meet in the next video Thank you"}
