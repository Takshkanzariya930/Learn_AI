You have just been hired as a Data Scientist Intern at CodeBook \u2013\nThe Social Media for Coders. This Delhi-based company is offering you a \u20b910 LPA\njob if you successfully complete this 1-month internship. But before you get there,\nyou must prove your skills using only Python\u2014no pandas, NumPy, or fancy\nlibraries!\nYour manager Puneet Kumar has assigned you your first task: analyzing a data\ndump of CodeBook users using pure Python. Your job is to load and explore the\ndata to understand its structure.\nTask 1: Load the User Data\nYour manager has given you a dataset containing information about CodeBook\nusers, their connections (friends), and the pages they have liked.\nThis is how the data will look (in JSON format):\n{\n\"users\": [\n{\"id\": 1, \"name\": \"Amit\", \"friends\": [2, 3], \"liked_pages\": [101]},\n{\"id\": 2, \"name\": \"Priya\", \"friends\": [1, 4], \"liked_pages\": [102]},\n{\"id\": 3, \"name\": \"Rahul\", \"friends\": [1], \"liked_pages\": [101, 103]},\n{\"id\": 4, \"name\": \"Sara\", \"friends\": [2], \"liked_pages\": [104]}\n],\n\"pages\": [\n{\"id\": 101, \"name\": \"Python Developers\"},\n{\"id\": 102, \"name\": \"Data Science Enthusiasts\"},\n{\"id\": 103, \"name\": \"AI & ML Community\"},\n{\"id\": 104, \"name\": \"Web Dev Hub\"}\n"}, {"number": "04", "title": "Coders_of_Delhi", "page_no": 2, "text": "We have to read this data and understand its structure. The data contains three\nmain components: 1. Users: Each user has an ID, name, a list of friends (by their\nIDs), and a list of liked pages (by their IDs). 2. Pages: Each page has an ID and a\nname. 3. Connections: Users can have multiple friends and can like multiple pages.\nTask 2: Read and Display the Data using Python\nYour goal is to load this data and print it in a structured way. Use Python\u2019s built-in\nmodules to accomplish this.\nSteps:\nSave the JSON data in a file ( codebook_data.json ).\nRead the JSON file using Python.\nPrint user details and their connections.\nPrint available pages.\nCode Implementation\nHere\u2019s a simple way to load and display the data:\n]\n}\n1. \n2. \n3. \n4. \nimport json\n# Load the JSON file\ndef load_data(filename):\nwith open(filename, \"r\") as file:\n        data = json.load(file)\nreturn data\n# Display users and their connections\ndef display_users(data):\nprint(\"Users and Their Connections:\\n\")\nfor user in data[\"users\"]:\n"}, {"number": "04", "title": "Coders_of_Delhi", "page_no": 3, "text": "Expected Output:\nNext Steps\nYour manager is happy with your progress but says: \u201cThe data looks messy.
