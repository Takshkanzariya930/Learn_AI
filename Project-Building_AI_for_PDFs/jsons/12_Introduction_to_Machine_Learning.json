Today, it\u2019s normal.\nTechnology is growing like never before, and Machine Learning (ML) is at the\ncenter of this transformation.\nBack in the 1990s, one of the earliest real-world applications of ML was the spam\nfilter. Imagine checking your email back then\u2014your inbox would often be flooded\nwith unwanted messages about dubious offers, miracle diets, or suspicious job\nproposals. Engineers started building systems that could learn to recognize these\nspam patterns based on examples. The idea wasn\u2019t to hard-code the rules (like \u201cif\nemail contains the word \u2018lottery\u2019, mark as spam\u201d) but instead to let the system \nlearn from actual spam and non-spam (ham) emails.\nOver time, as users kept marking messages as spam, the system learned to identify\nnew spam even before the user had to touch it. That was early machine learning in\naction.\n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n"}, {"number": "12", "title": "Introduction_to_Machine_Learning", "page_no": 3, "text": "What Machine Learning Is Not\nIf you download hundreds of books onto your computer, it doesn\u2019t automatically\nbecome smart. Your computer doesn\u2019t start writing like Shakespeare or\nsummarizing those books for you. It just stores data. That\u2019s not machine learning.\nThat\u2019s just data storage and retrieval.\nMachine Learning kicks in when a computer can improve at a task by learning\nfrom data and experience\u2014without being manually programmed for every\nscenario.\nWhat Machine Learning Is\nMachine Learning is the science (and art) of programming computers so they can \nlearn from data.\nHere\u2019s a slightly more general definition:\n\u201cMachine learning is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn\nwithout being explicitly programmed.\u201d \u2014 Arthur Samuel, 1959\nAnd a more engineering-focused one:\n\u201cA computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some\ntask T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured\nby P, improves with experience E.\u201d \u2014 Tom Mitchell, 1997\nLet\u2019s break that down with the spam filter example:\nTask (T): Identify whether an email is spam or not\nExperience (E): Examples of labeled emails (spam or ham)\nPerformance measure (P): Accuracy \u2014 how many emails are correctly\nclassified\nIf the system keeps getting better at flagging spam based on past emails, it is said\nto be learning.\n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n"}, {"number": "12", "title": "Introduction_to_Machine_Learning", "page_no": 4, "text": "The examples used to train the system are called the training set, and each\nindividual example is a training instance (or sample).
