Its a way to store data in a format that\nis easily accessible\nExample: Think of a library where books are organized by topic, author, and\ntitle \u2013 that\u2019s essentially what a database does with data.\nWhy Do We Need Databases?\nTo store, manage, and retrieve large amounts of data efficiently.\nTo prevent data duplication and maintain data integrity.\nTo allow multiple users to access and manipulate data simultaneously.\nWhat is SQL?\nSQL (Structured Query Language) is the standard programming language used to\ncommunicate with and manipulate databases.\nCommon operations using SQL:\nINSERT  \u2013 Add new records (CREATE)\nSELECT  \u2013 Retrieve data (READ)\nUPDATE  \u2013 Modify existing data (UPDATE)\nDELETE  \u2013 Remove records (DELETE)\n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n"}, {"number": "09", "title": "MySQL", "page_no": 2, "text": "These operations are usually referred to as CRUD Operations. CRUD stands for\nCreate, Read, Update, and Delete \u2014 the four basic operations used to manage data\nin a database.\nComparison with Excel\nDatabases and Excel may seem similar at first, but they work differently under the\nhood.\nIn Excel, a sheet is like a table in a database.\nEach row in the sheet is similar to a record (or entry) in a database table.\nEach column in Excel corresponds to a field (or attribute) in a table.\nExcel stores all data in one file, whereas a database can contain multiple\nrelated tables.\nIn databases, you can define strict data types and rules, which Excel doesn\u2019t\nenforce.\nUnlike Excel, databases allow complex querying, relationships between tables,\nand secure multi-user access.\nThink of a database as a more powerful, structured, and scalable version of\nExcel for data management.\nRelational vs Non-relational Databases\nRelational databases store data in structured tables with predefined schemas and\nrelationships between tables (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL). Non-relational databases\n(NoSQL) use flexible formats like documents, key-value pairs, or graphs, and don\u2019t\nrequire a fixed schema (e.g., MongoDB, Firebase).
