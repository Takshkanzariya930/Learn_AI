I am teaching Django framework using chai aur django course. Here are subtitle chunks containing video title, video number, start time in second, end time in second, text at that time:

{"title":{"22":"Chai aur Django","291":"Start a Django project and file structure","703":"Start a Django project and file structure","590":"Start a Django project and file structure","336":"Start a Django project and file structure"},"number":{"22":"01","291":"02","703":"02","590":"02","336":"02"},"start":{"22":78.6,"291":162.0,"703":988.0,"590":762.0,"336":252.0},"end":{"22":80.2,"291":164.0,"703":990.0,"590":764.0,"336":254.0},"text":{"22":" So what is Django?","291":" so see what is Django","703":" how django works","590":" django","336":" about Django"}}

------------------------------------------------

what is django

User asked this question related to video chunks, you have to answer where and how much content is taught in which video and at what timestamp and guide the user to go to that particular video. if user asks unrelated questions, tell user that only questions related to course can be asked.
