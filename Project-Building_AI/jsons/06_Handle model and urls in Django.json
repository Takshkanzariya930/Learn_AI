" Hello, how are you all? Welcome to Chai Aur Code and our unique YouTube channel where I am teaching you how to develop a full stack through Django Two important things One, we messed up a little in the sequence of series upload which is now fixed, playlist is arranged well and you are getting articles It happens sometimes Actually, what happened is the name of the same video was copied twice so I got confused All responsibility on me I messed it up, no team did it but now it is fixed Second important thing Our platform is now available on chaicode.com You will get all the articles, videos and code files and the platform is now available so the paid codes will also be available so it is almost ready So, what will we see in this video We have seen the basics of Django like templates, routes URLs, when to call them One more major aspect of Django is the models How it interacts with database How the database configuration is in Django We will see all of them from here We will see in this way that you will get 100% confidence that yes, I can also write models If you want to learn more about models then you can learn but I think the best way to learn Django models is through projects because how long you will go in documentation it is not possible So, as and when there is a requirement you can go and learn and if you make a few projects with someone it becomes very good In this model, we will see image upload how Django handles images I think one of the best way that Django handles images is that it keeps images in folders and saves the URL and not just puts the whole image in the DB It is also possible but it is not optimized Let's see Our comment target is 200 comments Not much, just 200 comments Do a little bit You are free now Push the series Let's share the screen and discuss it By the way, I will publish the entire article I have already written the article as a reference guide You will get it You are liking the article a lot Thank you so much for this So, where are we now? This is our VS Code I have activated our virtual environment and where are we now? Let me open it in a browser So, I have opened the browser and you know how to run the command It is very basic It is a simple Python manage.py run server This is our case where we run the server We have not seen much but we have the knowledge that we can keep the templates like this We can keep the templates inside the project like the tea project You can keep the template here We have all tea If you want to see the URL We have learned how to manage the URL We can go directly to the tea How will we know this? We will know it from the main project There are the URLs We are forwarding the redirection or the control of the URL after the tea to the tea.url We got to know about the tea because we have mentioned the tea in the settings.py So, the tea keyword came here and we said that there is a .url So, you can take the URL file So, we got to know it like this Now, we come here We have not worked on the UI We have told you how to use Tailwind I will try to do something more on Tailwind Components are just drag and drop We will see that later Now, we will come back to what else we have to do We have not done anything special yet I will tell you one more thing Now, you can go to the admin But, what happens is that you forget the login id and password Especially, if you are doing the development then it is a very obvious case For this, there is a Python script You can reset it I know that many of you must have got this problem So, we will go to Google And we will call it Reset Django admin password So, run manage.py You will get an option Python manage.py You can change the password of the user or the main db user I think the user was Hitesh Let's try this once Change password Let's run this with the user Let's kill it Python manage.py Change password I think Hitesh was the user's admin Change password Hitesh Password is too similar 8 characters Hitesh 123 Hitesh 123 Password is too similar and it is not giving the option to change it Chai1234 Chai1234 Chai1234 Now, I am happy that Chai1234 is the password Let's run this again and see if we can login to the admin Hitesh Password is Chai1234 Yes At least I am able to go to the admin and we can see that we have only one user Now, what we will do We want to use this admin but we don't have any Chai models So, for the first time, we will interact with the database to see how the database can help us Whenever you want to interact with the database the first step is Whenever you want to make anything data related you don't make it in the main project in the production If you don't make it in the production then why will you make it in the tutorial Here, you don't see the models.py file and it doesn't exist No one creates it The first app we created Remember, project and app are different Project is the whole project App is the small apps You can also call it micro services architecture It is not exactly, but you can call it No one will shout at you that why did you say We go to Chai, which is the new app Here, you have seen by default that you have models.py and admin.py file How are these files routed How are they associated with each other Let's discuss that First of all, for the database You can write models directly Why are you able to write directly? Why is it important to know? That's why you like tutorials Because everything has a detailed discussion It is fun to see Where is it coming from We know the framework like this We have seen it in front of our eyes First thing you see here is db.escolite This is an important file Because we have the whole sequel in it If you go to Chai and Django If you go to settings.py You will see many options here How do you handle the database The database we have is like this Our engine is Django.db.backends.escolite But these engines can be changed In fact, you have a complete URL of how to reset the database You can go and study it It is the best thing that we have been given the same We have escolite 3 But we have access to Postgres You have access to MySQL And MongoDB is also there But it takes a little extra configuration I have seen Django with SQL databases You get the option from here Now we know that we are using SQLite database But we can change the configuration here And put it in Postgres No need to change the code You do not interact directly with the database There is an ORM layer in between We interact with the database through the layer So in one setting you can go from SQLite to Postgres From Postgres to MySQL Now we reach Our main topic We have a lot of questions Now we reach Models.py How to write models in Django You can see that models are imported On the first line We will do all the work through this It is very easy to write models Suppose I write a simple class My model will be ChaiVariety I write the name of the class ChaiVariety My model is ChaiVariety I am making a table How to make this table You can take a dot from the top And take a model How to write a class It is very easy I can write all the fields I can write a name field You can write a name field How to write All are copy pasted We come to models As I have access to it As soon as you put a dot You will get all the fields You can take big integer, auto, average There are many Emails, enums I will tell you something You will get fast learning There are many fields Field depends on the suggestion Which database is active Like in Postgres There are some additional fields You will not get in the suggestion In case you use it, it will give an error Because in configuration, in settings, there is SQLite You are using the field of Postgres The most common field Char field, char field Character field You can pass some default options To know the options Or we will make some projects Then you will know the maximum Or documentation Max length, I need 100 characters In my name After that Image How to handle image For now, let's design the field Then I will tell you how to set For images But images are not supported You have to bring a third party plugin Which is pillow And then you have to do some additional settings To put my images in this folder For now, let's write We only need image field So we give it dot image field And after this image field You will also have to tell Where to upload Suppose I want to upload Now as soon as you save it You will see an error I will open it It has said Get pillow at To run the command Python-mpip install pillow So we will install it For now, let's go So images are handled When you upload your jango images It will put it in this folder You have to set the folder And save that url in the database And save that url in the database Not images Apart from this, suppose I have a field I have to take a date field I have to add date added here To add date, you have to take Timezone libraries But for that too we have jango available In jango, a class called utils You can say Through which you can import a lot of things Like here you see A lot of things are available Our use is simple Let's take timezone Now what is the benefit of taking timezone Now what is the benefit of taking timezone Now I can add timezone in models So models. Now you can add date time field Remember date field is different Date time field is different Date field only gives you date option Date time field gives you date and time option Depends on which one you want to use We will use it according to that So this is our date time field Now I can add default values You can add date time field by default But because I have to add default That's why I needed timezone So here you add timezone And write dot now So now you will get The exact time of now When this model will be created one by one Now suppose I have to add tea types Tea types should also be there Masala tea, ginger tea, ice tea Whichever tea you want So here I want User type to be restricted If you are making for a restaurant Then you will not be giving 1000 types Like I always give example If you are booking seat for airplane Then aisle middle window is the only option You will not give pilot seat So for this common database practice Is to keep enums So suppose I declare a variable Chai type choice And I give it An enum Now in this We will design a tuple So suppose I have ml I give it a name Masala We will duplicate it By putting comma Now next Suppose I have Ginger What will we call ginger Gr Other than that Is there any other So We will name it kl But we will name it kl For kiwi tea We have to give more options If you want plain tea We forgot And we will keep it Simple pl We will take one more I don't like it much But we will keep el For cardamom tea cardamom cardamom cardamom Now I want to design a field Which is highly dependent On these choices Where will we get suggestions We will tell you So I will name it type For type We will give a field So we will take Simple models It will be our care field But we will mention choices We will keep max length 2 because we have kept Abbreviation of 2 And you can give choices Choices are defined above You can give choice of tea type Little By writing indentation type Hmm Let's see There should not be much problem So this is our work Now you have all this available Now we will save This is step 1 How to design models As we move forward You will get to know Data types of models Chair field Images Date field And many more You can see in documentation I have given detailed article In documentation Now we handle our pillow To install pillow You can use command You can use uv Whatever you feel So we will type python M And use pillow PIP install pillow P capital of pillow Remember Now I run server Now there is no problem But now problem is Now you want to keep images To keep images Settings.py should know You will get images You have to set it once Then you can use it in any model You can use it in any app Let's go to settings.py Now here you have to give Media urls So here we give media urls You have to write exactly same There is no special option You have to give media url First Now I am going to take media So media slash It will be exactly same Now next You have to give media root So here media underscore root These two options Settings No one remembers Everyone makes notes You can see in blogs Here the work done above Is the same Static directories But settings will be same So you can copy from here Everyone does like this No need to worry You know what you are doing So there is no problem So with base directory Media will come That's it But there is one more thing You have done settings That url will be there But urls should know Because urls will serve So let's see how to serve This setting Your main project It will be in urls.py Not in particular app But in root You can call it root python url It is very easy First you have to import static asset It is very easy We do it here We need from We have to take settings Let's take settings We take jango And load jango configuration From configuration I need static Import and take settings Now you have settings I will tell you the usage We need one more From jango.conf And We need static And from here We will import static We need two settings There is no exception We have imported two settings How to use them This static method We have to tell From settings This media url Please load it How to write it From url patterns Add one more pattern Via static Static is a method This method will tell We have to load Settings We have to load settings This setting is for file We have to load settings From this We have to take media url You have to write Media underscore url You know We are giving this Plus You have to tell document root Here document You will not get in suggestion Document underscore root Mistake happens I don't know why I have not got in my editor We will take settings And tell Media root But it is written so many times Or it is copied That there are no issues We have told media root And media url In case If your model throws url Please check it We have worked properly Models defined Changed settings Configured url Now how to use The real super power Now I run it Actually The model you have written Your python jango Don't know We have done some changes In database You can load The changes of database For that We have a step Migration If you remember We have done jango In many videos We have seen errors And when we performed migration We have seen admin Because users came Similarly We have to migrate Last time we run one command Migrate Because everything was already configured Now You have to create Migrations Nothing much Just come in python And call it Make migrations It works with make migrations But good practice Migration of your app Migration of your app Or Just give command Migration of my app I am working in tea If your co-worker Is working in another folder Migration of all should not be We said make migration As soon as you created migration You have seen a new folder In this new folder Init.py and initial migration Let's see We have seen It is writing sql It is writing sql Same care field Big auto integer Primary keys That's why i say When you use models You never interact with sql You write like this Same code file If you want to go to mysql Or postgres Make migration jango It writes all migrations Or sql commands This is the best part Now when our migration is done We have understood What is in migration file Let's migrate Migrate Migrated Migrated Now it is available As a table If you have sqlite viewer I don't have sql But you can see It is plugin But how to use I have told you Now i will tell you About jango's super power You will get a file Which is admin.py Here it is Through admin.py You can attach any model And see in admin Super power Most important You have to subscribe And comment You are listening carefully And not sharing Tell me We are getting good content Back to back Share it Here You have admin Let's import model Go to .models File Import You can Import different classes We have Tea variety Now Register it To register One line Take site And register What to register Tea variety Not a single line Now You can see When you go to jango admin And reload After running Manage.py And here You can see tea varieties Tea varieties Spelling mistake It will work Now You can add All fields You can see Only fields In enums Masala tea Name it Small Ginger Ginger tea And File File Chai code png File Date time Now You can Change it Save it Now you can see Tea variety object Not good It would be better If we can configure it Let's do it In models.py At the end of class You can change it Simple code Def Define Dunder string function Underscore Dunder We don't do it We come to basic Return Common Self Name Save it And see Small ginger tea This is also Configure What are the options What are the fields You can see Completely manageable In short Let's add one more Suppose Large Masala tea Large masala tea One more Image Save it Save it Save it Save it Now We have 2 teas 2 teas We have understood How you bring values How you add them How you register in database You have understood Almost everything This is all and how to manage database and because you like big videos so I will not stop this video here otherwise it has become too big but ok, let's move ahead yes, if I would have made two videos then I would have made more look, I have made so many videos in this course but ok now, things have come in database but it is not only goal to come in database we need to suppose this template is all chai, in this I can show all chai and list it that will be better because database is set but I have to take values in database to frontend also how can I do that? so we go to views.py here we have already a field which is chais all chais, here I can take a request from database and all values coming from database I can forward them how? very easy let's declare a variable chais because all chais are coming name or not, we will see that later and what I do after coming here simple thing now I have to bring this chai variety and I have to see it so what I do here chai variety I want chai variety suggestions like this but sometimes it doesn't come why it is not coming? forgot to import? ok so how to import it? from.models import chai variety now hopefully let's give some distance now we have chai variety and because it is ORM you don't need to write sql it has documentation like dot, you have many options what you can do clean field, from database, full clean primary keys, validate many options and many more you can get by reading documentation for most of the interaction you use objects and then you give your operation like aggregation, accounts putting aliases many options I don't think anyone knows all options but not that much one option you get in db is all you run this method now it will query on chai models all models obviously all, then arrays you should know what data type you are expecting so that you can loop on it extract values or display now you have to pass third parameter we are sending you some more data name for data I am keeping chai because my variable will fill it that's it this is how you transfer values in frontend now you understand if values are in frontend then you have to handle it how to handle it I will tell you so it is not that difficult to handle values I will tell you in basic then you can do styling and styling task will be for you so let's go to templates I have already all chai which we made in last video and if we come here copy it so we have chai and we are loading template all chai sorry, we have to see in urls we are loading all chai let's go to all chai and here it is now I will introduce one more block you can introduce as many as you want this block is for block so for what will be in suggestions loop block let's use block now see how I have to use it I am thinking it will be better in suggestions ok, it is not ok, let's go we can take unnamed block yes, it is so first of all let's enter it now the block we are using is special it is for loop so how to do it first of all, write end for mess up with suggestions and the block you are taking is for loop so how to write block we use for keyword now the variable you are sending remember you are sending chai so this is an array because we have used objects.all so we have to loop on this for chai in chais chais because the object you are receiving is this so I have written it as it is now what will happen in every chai you will have access to the object so we use a div div and in this div you can use a class if you want as such we don't have any class defined so we write it as chai-item we will write it later now we need image now the important thing is how to get data especially image data chai.name but how to get image to get image we will inject a variable we have done it what is the variable you have chai now we have image in database or models we have said image whenever you store image you have to write url that's it let's save it refresh hmm we should get it what is the issue ok I think we are getting some issues oops I made a small mistake mistake is very simple we are loading content and block but actually our website is not loading so I tried let's write a test I think my block is not getting rendered and that's right because our template and layout we are loading only one content in layout only one content so it's outside no one knows about it so it's a very easy option cut this whole thing and add it here so we can inject block in block as we save it and it's getting looped so now let's start our tailwind because we have installed it so cd and chai django python manage.py tailwind start with this we can give some on the go styling not much but we can so let's start so first inside this loop or outside we start a div inside this div we can give tailwind classes some basic classes let's use grid and grid-col let's use 3 and gap gap-4 and move this div outside this end-4 so what will happen grid will come like this it's easy let's give margin margin-allside-4 margin came from both sides now what we can do further we can apply some styling or something like this not much but at least it's looking good let's class it it will look good it's looking good and instead of every chai item we can give some background color bg- grey 500 let's give it and a little bit here margin-5 no margin sorry we should have given padding margin-5 it's not looking good we need a little light color 200 it's looking worse let's try some other color let's try green or blue blue-500 let's make it darker ok you can do it it takes some time but it's looking good and here you can give more classes simple text-xl to xl font-bold font-bold ok not bad and here let's make it rounded rounded ok not bad and you can give shadows to the card let's do it shadow-lg looking good not bad so this is done if you want to show more data you know how to do it it's very easy if you want to introduce buttons let's introduce buttons let's introduce buttons so that we can take the button anywhere let's introduce a tag it's not going anywhere let's show you how to handle it let's introduce a simple button this button will tell which type of tea you are going let's insert two variables let's take the id of the tea or type whatever the type is and let's take the id of the tea to understand because id automatically gives you the database ml-2 let's add some classes so that we can I have many classes ok let's type equals no need of button class and here we have added all the classes so we have a button like this if you want you can block it can we do it? block inline flex let's try width 100% width dash 100% ok not bad it's ok could have been improved but it's ok now when I click on the button it's not going anywhere so how can I click on the button this portion is ok we will come back to this let's close it now I will give you one more iteration so that your journey gets settled now what we have to do our next goal is to add one more data field so that things will be easier suppose you have a requirement that you have given a good typefile but my tea doesn't have a description or maybe it doesn't have a pricing I will add one and you add another now I will take a description description you will add pricing like this and see how many number fields are there do some research and tell me in the comments now I will add models and through this I can take a text field in text field you have more options but if you add only text field then you will be considered as a compulsory field if you already have data in the database you have two options either you clean all the data or add new data if you want a compulsory description and if you want it to be empty you have two options the easiest one is default if no one has it then add it in all the fields now because you have added models so adding models means you have to perform some database operations how to perform it is very easy first make migrations because the model has changed as soon as I enter it, it is done you can also see the second migration what else has been added so see our dependency migration has been added in the tea variety description, text field so our migration is done now you have to migrate it so that it shows in the database now we come here and refresh our server is not working now I refresh it server is not working how will it work run server now hopefully it is working are you also working now we go here I have a description field available here now next you have the description field now what I want suppose I click on this button so I go to a new view and in that new view I see the description now I want this much detail and obviously you want to go to detail by clicking let's see how it performs first of all if you go to detail you need a new view if there is no view how will it get the data so first of all let's go to view there is all chai but if you want to go to a new view so first of all let's add a method what should we name it chai underscore detail here you go in detail obviously you know that you are requesting apart from that whoever comes on this URL will bring a chai id how will he bring it but a chai id will come there are many ways to give id but usually in this case you click on it you see a new id in the URL that is the basis of the id now I need a new chai variable which can go from database and bring the full detail on the basis of that id so here the method you will use the most is through django shortcuts so let's bring it django shortcuts you have to bring import and this method is called get list and 404 get object and 404 depends on what you are using if you didn't get the whole array then give 404 if we have that object then bring it or bring 404 so we will use get object and 404 using this method is the easiest you have to pass two things you can see manager and query set basically I have to pass chai variety from this model and you have to give the primary key what is the value of primary key my value is chai id which I will get easily you can put more filtering you can put data check chai id type is exactly that is basic after that return you will render but what will you render request is ok I will give you but there is no template so let's make template right click new file and let's call it chai underscore detail dot html now at least I have a data which I can load so let's give it to data so inside chai folder I have given a file which is chai underscore detail dot html now we have to pass object we have learned this above we have done chai before we will pass chai and we will do in quotes here is chai what will be the value we have given a variable view will be like this this is also good but view is not working alone I will click here URL should know where to go you are right you told me now we go to URL and tell it to handle this also it says ok let's duplicate this first handle path you will get primary keys by default database you can configure it but we have by default in db integer type keys so inside path after chai if we have an integer what will I treat it chai underscore id exactly chai underscore id slash it is not a special option it is called diamond bracket we have to keep it in it chai id because when views are coming you are calling it chai id if you call it something else it will be a problem we have brought all views we don't have all chai we have chai detail I will change name chai underscore detail you will get the impact of this name this name is very important we do a lot of work with it ok, it is saved now we have this work I know views how it will behave after going there I know how URL will look this is also fine now the chai html chai detail how it will get values we handle it it is very easy there are no rocket science first we copy paste it we have to bring it at least paste it whatever we have to for block we have to remove it end for div remove it we have to manipulate it we have to extend layout you can write chai detail page here is content we call it chai detail page chai detail page now technically we have to whenever I go after chai and write slash 1 I get chai detail page now step 1 from here if I take 1 it will reach next page from here if I take 2 how it will be done it will be done through anchor we come to all chai template if you remember I used a tag but now I don't need hash now I have to give dynamic URL remove it inject templates not variables these are templates we inject templates now what will be done next I have to use URL there are ways to use URL how you will use URL with URL you have to give name we have to see documentation first of all where will URL go I don't know whenever URL goes we have given name all chai detail when you use URL then name with URL you can use it copy and bring this name all chai go to this URL otherwise it becomes difficult you can give name but best way is define name of every URL so that you can reuse it but if you want to send you can send it put it in quotes this is string now what other parameters you have to send we are in loop and you can put dot id so that ID will be there now save it reload it now you have chai slash 1 as I click I have URL now I have 1 now you know relation URL is coming from here we also enjoy reading like this now we have detail now the easy part is to display values on chai detail how you can do it it is very easy because I don't have to loop you have only one variable and you can print any detail let's print description suppose this is H3 and I want to insert variable and I know chai is available and I have description I haven't written description yet I haven't so let's print name let's print large masala tea and ginger tea now I go here and add description this is description for large masala tea copy and save and for small ginger tea description for small ginger tea save now I can add description below H3 I write paragraph and tell it to insert variable and I know variable is available so I reload for description refresh now I have description let's make cardboard and display it you can use bootstrap but this task is for you now you know you can take all properties for one particular url we made url this is complete project this is database you have options for data you can add data fields you can manipulate you can give values when we come to home page we have all cards after card list you can click on any card now for assignment I won't leave without assignment here I don't have pricing so add pricing in basic string 50 or 60 I want pricing in pill now improve card after clicking you should get big card with big image title, description, pricing and back button so you can go back I think you enjoyed how detailed this project is very interesting by the way I will add source code in website so you can get all source code and when project will be finished, it will be published I hope you enjoyed this video we talked about models, urls how fast we are becoming full stack developer that too in python see you in next video"}
