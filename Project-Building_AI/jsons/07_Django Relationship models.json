Hello, how are you all? Welcome to Chai or Code and we are continuing our Django series. It's going well and you all supported us a lot. A lot of people are sharing and being stingy but what can we do about it? But thank you so much for those who shared and those who help us achieve our target in the comments Thank you for those who comment and those who are not doing anything then what can we say about them? Let's talk to you because you are the ones who promote this channel on Twitter and LinkedIn and we are growing with a lot of growth So in this video let's move ahead in our Django series There were some people who were spreading rumors that Sir has ended the Django series What? Yes, we will end it when we come and tell you Anyways, you all already know me those who follow me regularly So what will we do in this video? In this video, we will take Django one step ahead. If you remember we had read about Django's models and retrieved data from those models and deployed it on the front end Many of you have made really good cards and shared them on Twitter and LinkedIn So those who do this and are working and engaging those people can work and the rest are sitting on the sofa so you should also work In this video, we are talking about relational databases Django is mostly with SQL databases Right now we are using SQLite but the same interface is used for MySQL, Postgres or any other SQL databases Django gives you a wrapper through which you can talk to the database and not directly and this is a good thing that the database can be replaced under the hood In this video, we will talk about relations the one to many relations of the database and how all these relations can be used in the work We will see it in the code directly so that things are easy After that, we will show you the admin interface and will also show you the customization of the admin interface and finally, we will introduce you to forms which is a new topic but you will enjoy how Django handles forms and how you get built-in forms You just need to write their CSS and your work is done So let's start Comment target? Yes, thank you so much for asking It is not much, it is a target of 400 comments As soon as the target of 400 comments then only the new video will come Let's see how much time it takes If it takes a week, then the video will come after a week If it takes 3 days, then the video will come after 3 days So it depends on how fast you get 400 comments completed Because if there is no engagement then make some other kind of videos So you take care of that thing So let's share the screen with you So let's share the screen with you Now let's see how we can handle it This is our application Let's open it We are running it in Python So first of all we activate the virtual environment We should see the virtual environment We should see the virtual environment ls-la ls-la Is our virtual environment deleted? Oh nice! Our virtual environment is deleted Let's see What happened to us? Ok, we are back Actually I opened the wrong folder So I fixed the folder And now we can see that we have our virtual environment By the way, for those who don't know that we have launched a new website docs.chaicode.com Some people had a problem with this that what is the big deal in this new documentation Ok, you don't have to see it So now you can get the attached documentation of this video You can see the whole section of Django When you are watching this video you will see a new tab Just click on it And you will get all the documentation along with the detailed guide and source code So you don't have to worry You will get all the documentation Will you get a good habit of reading the documentation? Tell me in the comments Is it a good habit to read the documentation? Or is it a bad habit to ask who reads the documentation? So what we do is We enable the virtual environment I have already discussed the source in windows So we go to .venv We go to .venv We have the activate script It is activated And we come to python Let's see where we are ls cd chai django And in this python manage.py run server Hopefully, our server should be running And it is looking good Now we go to admin Because we will work on admin Hopefully, if I remember the password chai1234 Yes, I remember the password I didn't expect So we took chai varieties And we had 1-2 chai varieties Large masala tea, small ginger tea We had this kind of chai Let's add one more chai So that we can see what is happening We don't have large, small, medium So we Medium Medium Masala Tea We also need an image So let's add an image And we add Yes Let's add the image of our new course What is the type? Masala Date is now And Medium size Tea DSA with javascript New course It is good Let's save it And small ginger medium Now let's come to the source code Now we have to follow a lot of strategies It is not that we can Innovate anything randomly It is a framework We have to follow guidelines And there are guidelines to learn the framework So first we will talk about relationships We will not talk about form now We will talk about it later So first We are talking about relationships There are not many relationships in SQL First is one to many Second is many to many And then one to one Now you have two models Or two entities Like tea and review Now what can be the relation Between tea and review One tea can have multiple reviews One review can't have multiple teas So we have to see What can be the values Suppose we have a tea And a store So one tea can be available in multiple stores And in one store Multiple teas can be available So it is a many to many relationship So instead of studying these relationships in theory You might have studied it When you have studied database We study it in code It is easier and you will learn to write code And you will know the relations So I will tell you one by one On which relation we are working So that it will be easy So we come to our tea model By the way we already had a tea model We will copy it and show you How it looks Our model is not that good But the one you made was very good So this is tea It is not that bad But the one you made Was no doubt one of the best And the photos of tea were also good So what we do We open the tea folder And go to models.py Now you know that We have already made a model with the name of tea Now what we do We try to make more models How can we have more models One thing if you have noticed Already I can directly create an account in Django I can create an account and log in So by default in Django There is a table named user model There is a user table Which you can utilize You can associate and modify Where do you get it This is the most important thing To get it you have to take it from Django I will turn it off So we go to Django In Django You will get Contrib In this contrib also you will get auth And from this you can extract The models You don't have to do much You can see in the documentation Yes, people say What is the need of documentation What is the innovation So you can see it So I got this user There was no need but for now it is fine Now what we do We talk about the models one by one Which models are you talking about And why is it right Or it gives us the relation So first we come to one to many What is the meaning of one to many There is one entity And there is multiple Entities in my left hand There can be multiple entities What can be the most basic Tea reviews can be So we come to tea review Now in tea review Same thing as in models This is basic There is no rocket science innovation In one models.py You can define multiple classes Now we come to tea reviews How are the reviews The modeling of reviews Is almost same The fields are same We will not talk about two fields The rest of the fields are same Rating, integer, comment String, text Date also So it doesn't matter First thing is tea Because every review should be on tea And it is So we will bring a foreign key From models Foreign key means Tell me about the person I am talking to Primary key means My identity My Aadhar card, my PAN card But foreign key means Your role number, your unique identity I have to know So for foreign key You have to tell the model Which model are you talking to So I have given foreign key So first thing is Which model am I talking to You are talking to tea variety So I have written tea variety If it is in any other file Import it Now we come to Tea variety I will consider it as foreign key So good thing about Django You don't have to tell Which field you are attaching You can pass ID So you can see in this way And these are design decisions One you will see many times On delete So what to do with tea review Delete it with the above model Keep it as it is Because they are being associated So mostly you will see Cascade effect Use this On delete cascade And we have to bring it Cascade will not come like this We need cascade Now This is your assignment Cascade is a very basic thing What happens Now your assignment is You have to know what is cascade In database And you have to tell me in the comment section On twitter Write a small line You have to do assignment We will not let you sit here for free We will make you do the work Otherwise we are teachers So you have to know What is cascade And you can give a related name How do you want to give a related name Related name Has always been fruitful In my experience As I told you When we were giving name in urls It was easy in views So in the same way It will be easy That's it Now In the same way You can see here We take the user And associate the user Because we have learned so much We have one more model So we inject foreign key And who is the foreign key We have to inject user Where did the user come from We have taken the user from the top Now on delete We have to give Models.cascade Something related to delete You can see If you can't tell We will tell in the next video Now in your model You have to keep the regular fields You have already read a lot about them Keep the integer field I keep the integer field directly Your assignment is As we read last time You have to keep 1,2,3,4,5 If you want to keep rating strictly You can do that Now we come to comment We give the comment You can take the string field We take the text field You can give as much as you want We give the text field Now we keep the date added field We keep the date We will keep the date We take the date time field From the models We keep the default value We keep the default We take the time field And keep the noun It's very repetitive That's why we say Once you understand the code Then it's repetitive We saw that when we inject the stream In the admin The line will look beautiful It's just an object We bring the dunder string Dunder string And This is too much So, we get the self and return it in a formatted string There are different variations, this is a classic python, you can bring it as you like I will inject it here Here, something like this, and say self.user.username So that we know which user is giving And then we write a text, for which tea it is being reviewed So, self.tea, which field should we take from the tea? Let's take the name, we are taking the field by putting a dot, what else So this is our work, how you get one to many relations I think there is no problem now, you have a very easy work, now you have understood how it comes Now let's read the next, read a little more Now we come to our many to many Like I gave you an example, store is one of the best examples One of our tea can be in many stores, and there can be many types of tea in the store So when both can be many, then we keep it like this So store, we made a store, the rest of the work is the same Here, models.models So here we have the tea, stores Now, first of all, what we do, you don't have to do much in this When many to many is there, then you want to use it in the fields So see, what sense does it make for us, first of all, there should be a name of the store So first of all, let's handle it, models.textfield, carefield Let's take carefield, and let's say that your max length should be 100 So here, your max length is 100 Let's also take the location, which place is your store, which you have opened Let's take carefield in this too, so models.carefield And let's make the max length 100 As such, there is no requirement to make 100 Here, max length, but we do it Okay, oops, what has opened, let's close this Okay, now what we need is the tea variety Tea varieties Now its admin interface is the best So what we can do, we can directly tell Django that see, there is a many to many relationship here The way we told here that see, here is foreign key, so it understood that foreign key means one to many relation So it was a very easy task, you decide that it will be one to many or one to one, depends on the logic But when you have this kind of relation that it can be many to many So Django gives you many facilities in admin too Plus here it gives you the direct option that you can mark many to many field here Which field should be marked many to many, with whom should it be marked, so like I have to do with tea variety So here, with tea variety And giving related name is always good, related names, so all that is naming convention So I give it stores, that I will give relation with stores name Related name, you will see here that we have given related name here too Related name, reviews So you always give the name of that model that I, in other table, which name should I go with, that is related name So here also, in other table, which name should I go with, I will go with stores name You will go directly with stores name, but it is better to mention This will be very interesting, after seeing its admin, you will say that yes, this is very good So let's bring the dunder string, this is our dunder string And I have to see its easy template, because this is very big Ok, so let's remove this, we will not do much, let's write self.name and leave it There is no need to do much in this Now we have one to one field Now what can be one to one field, suppose every field will be associated with one, only one relationship can be made So suppose if you are giving certificate to the tea, then one certificate can be associated with one tea Student also has the same, if you are designing LMS, then one certificate can be associated with one student, at least in that course So every student will have a unique certificate, so what we do, we make certificate for tea We just want to understand, now you can say anything So let's write here, that we are studying one to one method Ok, let's scroll a little Class and let's call it tea certificate Yes, certificate, ok This is our models, from this we have model It was a very basic work, there was not much hi-fi So let's take tea, now what we do in tea, models And we will say this is our one to one field Yes, these are the two complex fields, many to many and one to one field So you can give a direct reference in Django that this will be a one to one field All the restrictions that have to be injected, Django will do all that work by itself You don't have to pay attention to more restrictions With whom do you have to do one to one field, here we have to do with tea variety, that is our tea variety On delete is required, we will use the same models.cascade Because you will read about it And you have to give related name, that what name should I go inside that table Or in reference of that table So certificate is a very good name, there is not much and it will be repeated Now we want that every certificate should get a number So certificate underscore number As such we are not keeping any restriction, we keep in business logic Usually restrictions are such that every certificate should be of unique number or something like this Now I will simply take char field and make max length 100 Here is max length and this is our 100 You can see how you have to do it Other than this I will also write issue date Issue underscore date, usually with certificates, issue date Issued date, it is looking better And same we have to take field, date time field Models.date time field Date field, take date time And same default value will be from time zone, now After writing models once or twice you feel that this is all looking like this I am just writing, yes it is like this Let's write valid date also Valid underscore until It is on you, write if you want to write, if not then don't write, there is no such load Models.date time field And we don't give any default value in this We keep this as it is Now with this we also bring dunder string Copy from above, it will be better Copy and paste Now we change this a little Let's write formatted string here Here is our string And let's call it certificate for So that it is written easily in admin For whom it is, self.name.chai For this field So this is our model Hopefully if we have not done any typo then you must have got a lot of ideas Let's give you a small summary That we made models first Chai variety, in it we studied in detail What kind of fields are there In this video we started to study relationship One to many was very easy There is not much in it, in one to many You just give foreign key That our reviews Will be associated with some tea So it was very basic In many to many we get the option directly You can give many to many fields in one to many Admin interface is next level Any field can come from any field Very good representation There is one to one field You get one to one field directly With which field you will be associated One certificate will get one chai And one chai will get one certificate Restriction of this thing jango will keep itself Now so much work is done Can we move forward No you can't move forward Because here you have to stop You have to update admin Before updating admin First you have to do migration Because it will not show in admin It does not know what you have changed in models Very easy work In python you take manage.py script And say make migrations This script will be You all will be confused Whenever you will do cheat in database First make migrations then migrate As soon as you do make migrations You will see migrations If you like to read sql What all they have written Here are all the sql What all models are being created How they are stored Many to many fields Very easy and very good Ok When migration is done Now we have to migrate So that everything goes in database Now you have written sql We go to migrate All operations are done Now you can debug Migration is done Now i can easily call python as run server But now the problem is If i go to admin panel And refresh I don't have any option What are you doing So you know For this we have to go to admin.py admin.py Last time When we were doing admin.py We only brought models We can do this But i think If we take it to next level You will enjoy Let's modify it First of all We import all the models Tea, variety, etc We import tea review Store And tea certificate I want all these Which i want to see in model admin First of all You can define classes in admin panel Suppose Tea review Inline I am making a class with this name In this Admin Which we have imported here If you remember You have many options How you can see this model in admin Or you want to see From auto discover To field list filter You can make a mini series Or detailed crash course On jango admin We will try To cover as much as possible But you will see tabular inline This option To show them That this works Is not very sensible You will see it in admin You will know Now we will put two options Which model i want to inject Tea review I will put in reviews I want to give feature in admin Where i see tea review I will get extra field Maybe i want to put two reviews In one place Maybe we add tea You want to see One, two, three boxes You want to add We add two in extra This is not a problem But you will see two fields Now We have more tea reviews We will add tea variety In a particular class It will be easy We have it now We have tea Tea Tea variety And tea variety admin We have same Same thing Models Admin Most common Model admin Whenever classes are made Tabular inline is one exception Mostly you will see model admin Whenever you want to Customize in jango admin Or enable or disable This is the syntax Admin.model admin How to modify Most common List display Read docs List display When you see admin Which is clickable Which is not List display List display List display links We play with list display This is a tuple If you want to give single field You remember this If you are giving one field You have to add comma We display two three fields Type You can display as much as you want Date Added When you are adding date added Remember that field should be there If not Error Date added That's it If you want You can add inlines Inlines Again What we do Chai Review Chai review Inline Sometimes It stops Chai review inline How it works Wait I know it's new When i make admin It will be easy Don't worry Let's make store admin Now it's repeat Take same admin Because it's customized class Take model admin Which field you want to add List display It's repetition Tuple Name and location Not much Location You can give as many fields as you want One more interesting thing Filter horizontal You get filters Like this My action Filter admin You can add filter You can add filter On the basis of Chai underscore Varieties You can add filter On the basis of Depends on Database model You can add filter Last admin So that it's done And then Add Last How it works Chai Certificate Admin Admin Admin Model admin List display So that you can see Difference Chai Chai And Certificate Underscore number We don't have certificate number It's important to see Certificate underscore Number We will see other fields later We have saved this much But it won't work Because you have customized classes If you have only model You can register it Now you have to give Which model you have And which class you have We already had chai variety And we have a new class Chai variety admin We have it You can see Whatever you want What else Remove Store Store admin Here Duplicate Add chai certificate Add chai certificate And Chai certificate admin Chai certificate admin Chai certificate admin You can see We have Chai review inline Means You can't give a direct review Because for review you need a reference Of which chai you are giving That's why we have used inline That's why admin is tabular inline Again, it's not making sense It will make in a minute I will run it I think There is an issue Let's restart it Let's fix it Must be a list or tuple Where is it Let's check it Let's check it Okay You know all the tuples There were two here So we need a comma Let's see Chai certificate Where is it Chai varieties is not a field of chai store Let's see Let's see Let's see it in a minute Chai varieties is not a table Let's comment it I think our server is working Because it's an important task Let's clear it Let's reload Now we can see Chai certificate is with you Chai varieties is with you Let's see First of all Let's see how chai review inline This is the impact When you go to chai variety You will see When you add a new chai Let's see You can see reviews section This is inline You have injected the model In existing chai We have written chai review inline Because I want to inject Chai review model But I want to inject inline We have injected it easily Chai review Admin tabular inline I think it's basics And I think it's clear In case you are confused How to know I want to go to chai review We did this in models When we made reviews We said you can go to one foreign country When you said inline It knows that I can go to one place So it reached here Let's add a new chai You will see reviews You are getting two fields Because we said I want to give two extra fields If you give three, you will get three If you give one, you will get one You have got all fields Date, time, user This is all Admin's super power You can give rating You can give comment This is our basic first step Next Chai variety We are adding chai variety admin This is just basics Nothing much Chai variety Let's go back Chai variety was same We didn't change any display Name, type and date Were added You have got name, type and date In case you want to see its visual Suppose I remove it For a minute Let's save it We have only name and type Let's bring it back Here it is You have got date added This is how admin customization is done You can see Which one is clicking We have given list display List display links So you can click on which one And which one is clickable Store admin This is very interesting This is many to many As you go to store As you add new store You can see How to add values Suppose we make Jaipur tea store Location is Jaipur And Add ginger tea I think We have Add chai variety We don't have chai variety Let's fix it Yes It is back Welcome to real world development Where bugs like this come And you have to fix it on the go It was a typo bug But I would like to give you a walkthrough If you remember We commented filter horizontal A minute ago Let me show you Because chai varieties were not working I thought we will handle it later But when we went to store admin Problem started As soon as I go to store I add store This interface is not like I wanted to show you And it is not working Because filter horizontal has to be given Otherwise how will store admin work So I said It is time to handle it So I started debugging To debug it First uncomment Now we have many issues For filter horizontal We have to see store admin You want to see store model Related name is stores But what is this many to many field It is called chai varieties Chai varieties We are getting from here And injecting it here Now you know the relation Many people may not like it But real world development is like this Debugging is there You also need to know this process Whether you are making tutorial or project You learn things like this When you see that the other person is also struggling He also has to debug I remove everything from editing No, it is better than day 1 But this does not happen Real world development is like this So we saved chai varieties As soon as we saved I thought it was fine Now you are getting to see These two fields How are they working And I think this is the most Superpower of many to many relationship As soon as you go to the store As soon as you add store Now you see how easily you can link Chai variety and this Suppose we have a store Our Jaipur store Jaipur Tea store Location is obvious Now you can tell here In Jaipur tea store We have small ginger tea We have large ginger tea But not medium So we said You tell us You have small ginger tea You can save it So this is one store If you want, let's make another store Delhi tea store Let's make Its location is Delhi And it has only Medium tea And it is saved Now you need more here Store, location, variety You can see it all easily This is our work How admin works And all the varieties of admin It is quite complex But in one video we got an overview How admin is configured How all relationships are configured And most importantly How can admin be configured We have added everything in the same app A lot of things happened Ok So let's do one thing So many things have been added And a small assignment has come for you So let's end this video here I wanted to add more forms But I think Let's do this for now Because the video is already lengthy Almost 40 minutes Fix some bugs So let's try In the next video, let's talk about forms Database, admin, relations I think it's over Now you just have to make a project And you will be able to polish it I think you must have found it interesting Especially the debugging part Which I did not edit So give me feedback on that I will make the editing disappear And everything will be fixed in one go Or you want this kind of experience Show us your struggle How did you debug How did you build the relation How did you trace the stack Tell me in the comment section See you in the next video In the next video, we will discuss forms It will be more fun"}
