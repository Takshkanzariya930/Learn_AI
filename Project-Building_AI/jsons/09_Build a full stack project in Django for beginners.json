Welcome to our channel, Anokhya YouTube Thank you so much for coming here This is a long short video The final video of our Django series In this final video We will make a massive project Which will give us an idea of Django's complete flow How the framework works What are the flows, what are the inner details How are the customizations And all the things we have learned will be a practical implementation Before moving ahead, the most important thing Thank you so much for all the love and support you have given us Thank you from the bottom of our hearts Second important thing, if you haven't subscribed yet, please do so Next important thing Yes, there is a comment target Not much, but a target of 1000 comments Because it is a big project, comprising of almost 7-8 videos This is one video I wish I could upload them separately But I thought I should share the whole video with you So that you can also make a complete project And you can feel confident that I can also build something in Django So that's why, and 1000 comments is not much So please complete it One interesting thing, if you are facing any problem Please join us on Discord Our Discord is available for everyone And there are almost 40,000 people on Discord Who are active Consider it as a coding hostel You can read from anywhere, no problem Come and take help from there, take support I am also active there Code files are available for you I have already uploaded everything on Chaicode.com So you can take all the code files from there And everything is available for you Now let's talk about what we are going to do in this video This video will give you complete confidence How I can build a customised application in Django We won't focus too much on UI You can use Tailwind if you want Which I have already taught You can use Bootstrap Material if you want Our goal in this video is To see the complete flow of Django In one project How Django projects are created How Django apps are created And how Django models are designed Then we will see forms are designed Views are designed Those views are locked So that only the logged in user can see some views We will learn to keep some views open publicly Not only that, we will see How to make Django We can build forms only by using Django and Django's forms One of the super power of Django is built in forms Not only that, we will see How to perform custom user registration, custom user login and custom user logout After seeing custom user login performance and registration You will feel that all these things are inbuilt and can be modified And you can also create existing ones One of the goal of this project is To give you confidence and know the flow of Django In these frameworks, the most important thing is To know the flow and architecture Where and what is there Because of which error Which thing is causing us problem and how to fix it We have not removed any errors We will do debugging together We will see together that which error is coming and how to resolve it Which is an essential part of programming And in the same way, we will build a complete application With customized user registration, customized login, customized logout And other than that, customized form creation Regular Django form creation Models, forms, views, urls And customized settings, static images upload We will see a lot of things You will like it a lot, it will be fun And if you are enjoying it, then please click a selfie I feel very good when you are reading on this channel And upload a selfie on Twitter, LinkedIn or anywhere So it feels good to know that you are reading Tell us in the comments which states, which countries, which cities are you watching It feels good to know that everyone is reading So that's it, we have talked a lot Now let's start with the next segment How are we going to do it We will set up from scratch So in case if you have not seen the old videos Then also there is no problem You can also start from here easily So let's start with the next segment Our mega project of Django And thank you so much, this is the final video of this series Yes, how are you all Welcome to Chai Aur Code Our unique YouTube channel Which you have given a lot of love Thank you so much for that and subscribe too And let's start our Django mega project Whenever you are watching the video, you are watching it in one shot In this section we will discuss How are we going to build the project Or what is the future goal What are we going to build Okay, let me tell you one more small thing I had commented and messaged Will you cover Django REST framework in this See, you have the right to ask It is my duty to explain that too See, Django and Django REST framework Are two completely different things Like React and Next.js We cannot mix these two Like there was a separate playlist on the channel React came separately, Next.js came separately Some people said mix Next.js in React Or read React in Next This does not happen If you want to read and learn professionally So keeping things separate is also a task Which I have to do So just for clarity Django is a different thing Django REST framework is a different thing Like this Flask is different, FastAPI is different So if things are separate Then it is right and also beneficial to learn Django REST framework is useful through Django But this is like Next.js comes through React But it should not be done REST framework, REST API Is more centric, more focused Django framework is complete For making full applications For templating engine And its use case is there So we will not cover Django REST framework in this playlist There will be a separate playlist for that If it comes, whenever it comes So please understand the difference And explaining is my duty Like asking is your duty So I hope this is clear to you Now I will walk you through in this segment In this portion, in this video We will make a project What is our goal There are so many nit gritties in Django Because it is an old framework Well established, well stable So there are so many things in it You will see that Experts have worked for 2-3 years They also keep exploring Is this also possible In Django or any framework The best thing is to build more and more And learn more things on the go We are going to do the same If there is a new requirement in the project Then learn new topics It does not make much sense to pick them and learn So what we will see in this project It covers all of your full stack With authentication Django forms everything is covered So I think you will find a lot of interest And it will be a lot of fun Let me give you a small walkthrough What we are going to build in this Let's share the screen in front of you So in this way we will build our project here This is a small different twitter style application Where we have Login and register button We also have tweets One is tweeted by Pankaj One is tweeted by Hitesh This is Pankaj's tweet This is another tweet for cricket Now you will see that you have a create tweet button Obviously we are taking images And we are also taking text This is the most important thing You can take images, you can take text You can manipulate the text As soon as you do create tweet You are not allowed to tweet Because you are not a logged in user But you can see that you are allowed to read tweets So we will see that selectively Which routes can be authenticated Some routes or some views We can make publicly available So both our context is covered here Now let's create tweet There is no account, so let's go to the register account first This is the whole registration form I have not built it, we are using the power of Django forms In fact, I have not written a line I have written all the html auto generated I have written a little bit, but mostly auto generated Now let's take the username Suppose we take the new user Shubham Let's take Shubham's email Shubham at the rate gmail.com And password I am keeping the same password 12345 So that I remember what is kept here 12345 By the way, we have used all the forms of Django And all the forms and manipulations Like your password can be too similar These are all the default security mechanisms of Django Like suppose if I miss a few letters here And try to register So the password to match the field You can also give them Authentication Conditionally red colors or all that It is a very basic thing, there is nothing in it But you can see that our forms have also been auto filled Have also been removed, you can write again If the email is not correct in this way So now Django is checking itself We are not doing anything, we are using Django's super power Let's register Oops Wrong Hopefully it is right this time Okay So we do Register in the name of Shubham And it has been registered After registering, the flow we made We have also logged it directly You can remove it if you want, we will discuss that flow Obviously After logging in, you will see that I can create a tweet So this is a text box, we are using Django again No customized form has been made You can manipulate it, you can redesign it There are many ways to make the forms Better You can also write classes there We have not written it, we wanted to do it directly in the basic flow In the coming future projects Obviously we will craft it more As the projects will come They will come So this is another Tweet To subscribe Subscribe Chai or Code YouTube Channel Let's choose a photo I think This photo has been used Let's use this And let's submit This is our tweet Now you will see I have done this tweet So I can see edit and delete buttons You can make more beautiful buttons But I can edit it Hope Hope you will Enjoy The content We have submitted it Our tweet has been edited There are restrictions in the tweet You can delete it Let's delete it Delete this tweet Let's choose a photo Let's choose a photo Let's submit You can delete it We have deleted it We have reached the confirmation page You can go back We have deleted it If you want You can delete it You can log out As soon as you log out You will not see the buttons You can create a tweet You can log in You can log in You can register As you want This is a basic project But it will teach you a lot of details I think This project will make your foundation Because The goal is not to learn foundation But to use it You can build a foundation You can change CSS You can read about registration You can read about users We have admin I think I have created admin We have admin Where we have fully controlled Yes We have admin dashboard We have tweets You can manipulate any tweets All users are associated You can see the list of all users The signup You can access the roles You can access the roles We have the complete configuration We have the complete configuration We will see how it is done It is a very good project It is a very good project I hope you are excited about this project I hope you are excited about this project Because this is our first foundation project We will increase the complexity of our projects But this will be our final project But this will be our final project We will say goodbye to this series We will say goodbye to this series With a decent project We will increase the complexity So subscribe See you in the next video We start this project We will make many revision We will make many revision Let's continue our Django series In this segment we will do project setup Project setup is going to be fast Last time when we were learning project setup and app setup The flow was slow Now it will be fast Let me tell you how to get documentation help Here we have documentation Everyone knows documentation is available on docs.shycore.com No need to read the whole documentation We will work on it as we see I know I have created a folder called Django final I have to create a project in it But I don't want to create a direct project I want to create a virtual environment Now it is obvious who remembers how to create a virtual environment Let's go to docs and see how to create Getting started with Django From this line our virtual environment will be created Copy it Here it is Our virtual environment is created Now you must remember how to enable virtual environment I remember, go to source Then go to .venv Then bin And activate Now my virtual environment is activated If you don't remember, no problem Go here and copy paste Now you have to do Django install We don't have to do all this I have told you this optionally If you want to do it Then install Django Let's do it Here we go And install Django Alright Hopefully it should be done quickly Here it is We have done Django If you want to upgrade, you can Let's do it Copy and paste And pip will be upgraded One common thing you will see Pip is being freezed When you make a project And make a requirement Then pip is being freezed And then we put it in requirements Requirements.txt Simple txt file And whatever you are installing in vnish It is in the requirements file It is a package.json Whatever you install In the last project After installation or project finish We install it in requirements We push it You will see a command If you want to install from a file Then pip install Whatever dependencies of the package Like images, pillow, etc It will do all the work How to start Django project Django admin start project And whatever you want to name the project We also do it here Django admin Start project And we name this project Chai center Chai HQ Chai headquater It will look good We give it in chai headquater Our project is created It is obvious We can go inside And run the server It was very easy By using documentation You can make things easy for yourself We go inside Chai HQ And we list it You have manage.py file So python manage.py Run server What is the situation We go to run server Django is running You know the steps of migration We have already taken the expertise We have some users model Which will go to admin And they are not migrated If you remember the command Then search it Manage.py Make migrations After making 2-3 projects Everyone remembers Make migrations And then migrate Migration was not needed But we did it Now you will run the server You will not get any error But we had to go inside admin Now I have to create super user But I don't remember the command How to create super user Let's search Super user Here Django admin Django admin Django models Adding data to database We have to improve the searching Update the admin Here it is This is the update of admin We don't need it We need it Let's search in the right side Here Creating our first view Adding template Ginger templates Apps, templates, common layout Django models Relationship and forms Update the admin Adding forms We have to improve it How to see the admin We should have seen Django project, Django server Creating views We will see it But we know the command We need admin Python Manage.py Create super user Let's create super user Username Hitesh Email address Hitesh Gmail.com Password Chai12345 Chai12345 Chai12345 Super user is created Now we can run the server Let's see Admin Admin Admin Hitesh Chai12345 We are going smoothly We are able to do things fast Now we know It's not a big deal One thing is done Let's do some more setup When we have done this much setup Let's stop it Let's see what else we can do This is our Chai head queue We know some things We have to do Like images We have to take it Let's import OS Let's import OS You don't have to import in new configuration It doesn't matter It's just a configuration You can do it through OS Or any utility In short You have to do configurations Let's see First we have to do media configuration You can find it In the Django models We have Creating views Templates Pillow After that Before adding data to database We have to add a headline So that it can be easily searched We have to give media URL Copy it Nobody remembers it Everybody keeps it in notes So this is our media work In case if you want to work with static files I think We have it in Jinja templates Apps in Django And static Let's search Static So here are our static configurations All right It should be here Because there are URLs All right Let's improve it Let's write it We keep it in notes As you saw earlier You can keep your static assets In a static folder Like CSS or Javascript And can be served This is basically the role These are our two assets You can't use it Because you have to add static media To add static media Go to URLs And at the end Where URL patterns are ending We write plus static And settings media URL You saw We can't do it like this We need import settings Which is in Django configuration Nobody remembers it You need static settings So we need to see Where are the settings Let's see All right Here is our simple documentation When we created Django models Then we have this configuration Here is our static file configuration You can copy it as it is These are two top lines Which import things So let's import it Here it is And then this thing So now Our documentation is ready You don't need to do anything else You should know Where and how things are going Like in settings py file Our media will go to slash media So I am writing media And media root If you have any other intentional folder Write it I know static is going to static file It is not important Where are you copying from And once foundation is solid So now I think this is the only thing That we have to do So let's close it And now let's create a new app Creating a new app Is very easy Let's search start app Because start project Was done Now let's do apps in Django So python manage.py start app And then whatever is the name of the app Let's copy These were the steps Let's open it And we will name it Tweet Try tweet Tweet Start app Start project starts the complete project In Django everything is an app So we will start an app With the name tweet As soon as you start You will get a new folder In this folder you will not get Forms or urls So the most common scenario Is to create a file With the name urls.py Now what will be the data in this file I don't remember So at least I copied the data From the main urls file And let's copy the data So we have by default All the things Mostly So this is the basic Work How to get the basic Urls We will go more in this But now we don't need admin So let's stop it And here also We don't need anything So let's keep it empty Let's comment it Because we have to come back here And you don't need anything So let's make a small view And You won't be able to test Whether the application is working So let's make a small view And through that We will make a template Index.html and we will Insert it in the url So at least our application Will be in runnable format So let's make a small index And put the request in it And we won't do much Let's return the render In suggestion Render is here So you know You give the request and You know which template you want to load So index.html We didn't set the templates So we will do that in a minute So for now Our view is clear Now how to use this view So let's go to urls First we have to import So From.importviews So let's Uncomment it Because we have a path And in this path We will put the url patterns And we will write the name Views.index We have only one And we will give the name Name equals Index Obviously we will change it later We didn't import django urls So we have to copy And paste it And paste it on top So we have the path But we are not done yet We don't have index.html And we haven't told Our main urls That we have a new app So first we have to go to settings And tell them to install a new app So go to installed apps And click on install And click on install So go to installed apps And tell them that We have installed a tweet Let's also put a comma Just for fun So we are done You have a new app You have informed us Thank you so much But we have to Configure templates in urls So templates are very easy We have to join os path From base directory and templates Let's search in documentation How to Get templates And settings Here is the conclusion Because we haven't Made customized templates Let's see Installed apps If we get it, it will be easier Let's search Templates Ginger templates We have to have it here Model defined Static files We have added here Time is wasting Sometimes we have to do hunting But it was very easy So simple os.path.join Who has to join Base directory Base directory is a variable And write Templates So we have templates Now you can Put a template folder in every app Which will be hunted We will put it outside But for now, let's put it here I can put it here I can put it in headq And make a new folder Which will be templates Especially templates I can make a new file Which will be index.html And I can add a basic template Test template This is how project setup First you do testing So test template Let's walk through After making app Go to settings.py Give information about app We forgot to set template Because it is a one time setting After that Go to urls.py And we have not informed it That we have a new app Now it will take control of url So Let's duplicate it And Let's say We have a tweet related work We will include it In tweet related work First we need include It is near path Here it is And we don't need admin site So here it is You write include Because you have already Informed django in installed app So you can write its name directly Otherwise you won't be able to So we have A tweet Which is in string And from here Go to urls.py And take rest of the information So now We have taken all the control Which will be after tweet User will write slash tweet User won't get anything on home page So we will go to tweet And control will be passed In our tweet app So we will go to urls.py And we will render A view on home page And here we have given its name Now because we will render view So we should go to views file Here we have told That we will render index.html And index.html is in our Folder Oops, we have made it in chai.hq So it's ok We will move it in tweet And move it So now we have template And index.html So this is a realistic ground This is how real application is made Sometimes you confuse configuration Like we did with templates This is how you analyze flow Now hopefully we should have Python manage.py run server Oops Run server Here we go So here Static directory settings Does not exist Ok, it's a warning But let it be We will see that our static directory Where is the problem In that Alright It should not have come But let's go to settings And see if we have any static directory issue It should not be Static, os path Base directory, settings Let's see this too Let's open our app It was expected That you will see this error page Because our debug is true You can also define a view on the homepage And give a basic homepage My concern is In tweet I can see test template It's a little bit Sticky So we come here Style Body BGC 0 0 And here Color Colon Hopefully It will be fine now Ok, now it's fine It was a little white So at least We have the application ready Set ready We have to see static directory We have to see static directory There is a little issue We will see it later At least We have tweet Admin Properly configured At least Our project is up and running And working So this was our next segment How we set up the project Enabled admin Enabled media files App Main app Settings URL Template Smooth experience We can configure a project Now How to work We will discuss it later For me next video For you next segment See you in the next video Alright See you in the next video For me next video For you next segment What we will do in this segment First we will configure our layout Base template We will configure it Then we will make models Forms And connect it with our back end admin It's a small task Nothing much We will do it together Take tea and sit Tell me Have you subscribed You can do it But for sharing It's not a big deal Let's go Let's share the screen I forgot to share the screen Here it is What to do first I fixed The static bug It was a warning It's not coming I forgot to make a static folder I made it Where We have a project I made it In the configuration file It's not a big deal It's done What to do next We have to configure templates Where to configure We have templates In our project And often you will see That Almost every time The layout template Is kept in the project Because we have to do the same structure So here We make a folder And in this template I make a new file Layout.html It's totally up to you It doesn't matter We have a basic boilerplate template We do two things Usually It's a standard practice First of all We load static Static Static Load static In the suggestion First of all Whether you have static assets It doesn't matter It's a standard practice In case later Some user added it So this is the basic Now In the title Remove the document And add a block Unnamed block And name the block title If someone wants to manipulate It can be done easily But if someone hasn't given any title Then we put chai and django It will be a little branding We put chai and django After that We need a block content So that we can serve the content We make a div And put a class Container So that everything looks good And we do Unnamed block And call this block Content Now it's up to you Give the name of the block It doesn't matter This is the basic template Now we need to extend This template Before that Let's arrange our CSS I know many of you will say Why bootstrap? You told tailwind It depends on you Which library you want to use I wanted to work fast We thought to use bootstrap I have already taught you tailwind In the series You can inject it The way we inject It's not an optimized way Here You have to install it You get the CSS library Like this This library We are going to use it And inject it in the page The good thing is It gets bloated But it's not a big deal We inject it Now in the page Bootstrap is enabled One thing is done Now We wrap the content In this How is the content Here Now the content is like this Let's modify it Let's go to our project Which is tweet And templates And index.html I don't want to give index We will extend it Extends And our file is layout You don't have to give the whole path Because automatically You get the layout file In the project level Otherwise it will be in your project It's not a big deal This is our basic Now we come to a block Unnamed block And the first block is title So that whatever code is written here It gets injected So we will call it Chai or tweet We get tea in everything You must know this much This is the basic Now let's add the block content So we have Unnamed And this is the content So it will depend on the name of the block What do you want to add Let's take a simple h1 Let's do this first You come here And write Welcome to Chai Chai's Django project So we know which content is coming from where How it is coming Let's refresh Welcome to Django's project Don't worry We will not give you so much trouble We will not make it so white We will use a little bit of bootstrap knowledge It's not a big deal Subscribe And share the video We come here And call it Darken bg This is a simple class that is injected in the body After this Eyes get some rest And we have a welcome to Chai Django project But bg is dark So everything is dark So every text Either you give it in the body It's up to you How you want to add it There are 2-3 things in it How you can navigate it How you can maintain it For now bg dark The content should have been white Technically If not, we will see it later Add the class here And call it Text-center And call it text-white Let's see It's fine Let's take a little margin Top-4 It's fine We are not going to write much css But our work is done Now I know All the pages I will write here I need a common navigation bar We will pick up the navigation bar From bootstrap So come here Navbar And here it is Pick the one you like I will pick this one Copy to clipboard Let's go to code section Because it will come everywhere So we go to layout Above our container Above the container Add it And save it And make some changes Instead of navbar Let's write tweet bar I don't know why But I wrote it Let's see I think we will get this tweet bar We can do something else We have navbar And expanded Body is bg-dark Let's see in bootstrap Background dark bg-dark Dark mode Enable dark mode You tell me In html bs-theme-dark I think it will be like this Let's do it Alright Let's go to html In layout And inject it in layout html I think now We don't need bg-dark Let's see And reload Alright I think now We don't need text-white Let's save it And reload Now everything is fine Navbar, tweet bar, buttons We will manipulate it later But for now, everything is fine At least we have a basic layout It won't look bad At least it will be visible And this is the main goal If you are going to use tailwind It will be made by some associate Or some junior Or some component library It's the same Now what to do next Let's pause Put timestamp We have done the layout Add timestamp I will add major timestamp You can add this Now let's make models Let's go to tweet And tell models.py We have to make one model Not more Just one The most interesting thing We will import django It's a little long Eventually you will remember In contrib There is an auth In which you get models From here you can import User This is the file Where you register django The user in admin panel This user This user group Comes from here All users you see here If you want to use the whole It's editable, configurable You can change anything Change username, email Add more fields Everything is configurable It's just a file Now let's bring A tweet We have models.models This is a basic syntax Nothing special First we will associate user This is our classic SQL 101 Or SQL Databases 101 We have primary keys Foreign keys I want every tweet To be associated with a user We are not taking unknown tweets We will inject foreign In models. Two parameters are major Which table you want to refer We want to refer user table That's why we brought OnDelete To avoid database mess In last videos I told you to read cascade Many of you answered Thank you so much Read it We need text field Obviously tweet will have text We have two options For text Text field And char field Char field Is like an input Simple input Like name, email We will auto generate Forms through this So it's important To choose text field Or char field Char field will have only one line Text field will have a big text field We will use that We will bring text field In text field You can define max length We are taking 240 characters You can take as many as you want We need photo Here it is We have image field We read it last Here is image field We have to tell image field Where to keep all We will say Put it in photos You can put As you want You can put As you want I will make it true So you can Make it true If you make it true Then null will be true If it is blank then null will be true Now We don't have much field But we will keep it Created underscore at So database is correct You know when values are created We will keep it Date time field Auto now Add true You have done In case if you manipulate We can manipulate So updated at We will keep it Sometimes There is a noise We have to pause We were created at And we have to make updated at So this is also correct Models dot Same And in this We will make auto now true Here it is Auto now add and auto now true Automatically When it will update It will run at the same time As it is added So this is our basic model We will add Dunder Underscore underscore string And then Self Here The benefit is When we will integrate it in admin So from this class We will get a demo Or a url To modify it Nothing else So we will use formatted string First we will Take user name Self dot user dot Username Models define And we will take text Dash Self Self dot Text You can take whole text We will take 10 characters So Now we have models define So this was major work Models define Let's migrate this model And then see what else So come here First it said add pillow We forgot But now we know Adding pillow is not a big work We will add pillow Copy Kill And add pillow Now i will tell you an interesting So we add requirement dot txt Whenever you add anything Freeze pip Freeze means dependency And redirect it Requirement Requirement Dot txt So whatever additional Will come here Ok We added it inside Pillow is here We should have done outside But you understood We did it outside Because we are here So we made it outside So we take it outside Copy Paste Save We don't need inside We should have done outside We did some mistake But it's ok You will do it So this was our work So we will do migration So Python Manage dot py Make Migrations I forgot it We have to do tweet migration So this is our migration Migration folders are here And then Migrate And then Run server Here Hopefully everything is ok Let's refresh We didn't get it Because we didn't register it in admin After model We have to register it in admin.py It's easy So we do Dot Import tweet Now we have to register it Register it in admin Register And who to register? Tweet Just save Nothing much And refresh Now we have 0 tweets We have one user Hitesh This is first Tweet For big project We will add image We start with This And save That's it Some characters are here Hitesh and first Now we have Models We have model in admin Now we will make forms In this section Create new file in tweet Because forms are not there So forms dot py Common mistake Spelling mistake In django I have more No problem Now we have to create forms First import forms Then models Two are standard practice From django import forms Here And from dot models Import We have only one Tweet Now forms Is very basic Because You want to associate existing models With django Input fields And use You don't have to work You can pass data in views But we don't want to We want to use django In future we will make such projects Where we want to use our own forms We will do that in future If you subscribe And share So we will name it Tweet form In this We will insert Model form In this Standard format You make a meta class No other option You have to make In this you have to give Model You can use all fields We will give Model And fields You can use The biggest problem Is array If there was something else You would get suggestions But you have to write manually I don't like it Now this text and photo Is not in air I have written text and photo I have written text and photo If there is something else You can add it This is all This is our models This is our forms Now next What to do Now next Logical section Is views We have to write a lot of views Because We have to list Tweets Edit Delete All these things We will do it in next segment Or in next video Hopefully you are following So do tell in comments That this much section is complete It feels good So let's meet In next segment Yes How are you all Greetings to all For us Morning is early We thought to record videos For you So let's go We have done a lot of work In our project So let's start So let's share screen We reached here So on views We have to start some work Till now We have done a lot We have created models Forms And admin We have registered Now last work Is views Because Views will define functionality And where these views will act Will be our jinja templates Which are simple html templates We will see templates later First we will discuss views Because it is major work After that everything will be easy So let's go one by one First work We have to do import statements So that we can import things So We import things Alright, so what do we need first First we need models We will need models And through this we import We have one tweet model We have to import from forms So we import From.forms Import I think this is tweet form Let's check Yes it is Alright We need these two things We don't have any other option And one more thing we need Get objects Because jango Put layers With which you can interact with database And you can use shortcuts From jango So From jango.shortcuts Import Get Get list and 404 Get object and 404 We will use get object and 404 You can use other one Ok So this is our import work You see we discuss each functionality And make it First functionality All tweets All tweets List on one page So we make a function Tweet underscore list You can name it as you want And basic you know We give request Now how to get tweets The way to get tweets is very simple Use tweet model Always use objects Now what we need We need to create And create Now i need all So write it as .all I need all And you can Order by I do it I do created at So dash I feel it is little strange That i have to write created at in string So i don't get suggestions But what we can do Now It depends on How you are getting tweets We said give all Now it depends on What you get We will discuss it later And how to improve functionality We store all in a variable And return it Return render Now request We have to send And send all tweet list On which page We have to send We don't have any template But we can do it We will make it later And what you have to pass I have to pass data Tweets And where will this data come From our tweets Suggestion Here it is So this is our work All tweet list Now i will tell you How to modify it How to take more values How to improve We will give you assignment So first work is done We have list Second work is We have to create tweets So let's make method Tweet underscore create And we need request Now when we have to create tweet How to create You have to give form Now in that form Maybe user has submitted And we have to accept And maybe we are giving empty form So this is very standard In Django First we handle Suppose we have a request And we are handling that request Second case is We are giving empty form And third case is User has received all form So we have to render So for this First we will handle In if case What data we are getting I will write pass But later we will do Else case In else case Take a form And how to create As it is Now we have form And we have to After this Whatever work you have Whether you have filled Or you have empty form So here we return Render And in render We have to give request And take tweet form Tweet underscore form Dot html And send whole data Here we have form And here form Basic is Any given how In case or else case You have form If not then you will see Now this is the case When we are giving empty form Now if user has filled form So how to handle So here we have request And we use method And first we check Is this request post Because obviously If you have filled form Then you should get request Now we remove this And show you How to design So you need tweet form And this tweet form Will give you access So first request dot post Here you have post level form Now with this Optionally if you are accepting file Then you don't have to do much You have to see request dot files With this Now you are accepting files Now because you have accepted files So take object of this form Here Now you have taken post data And you have taken files Now in django there are some standardized methods Which tell form Is it valid or not Because django gives some built in security features Like csrf security, cross site request forgery So for that you can keep A simple method dot is Suggestion should have come Is valid If this method is executed Then only we will process form This line handles many security measures And you will see this almost everywhere Now what we have to do We have to save tweet But the tweet we have designed We are taking data But who has sent that data We need that user Because here it is user So we can take that Whenever form is filled With that automatically You get user So what we do first We worry about form So we save form Here we are saving One option is necessary Which is commit Commit equals false I don't want to save it in database Now only save form So once form is here We have handled tweet Now we have to add One more property in this tweet Which is user Tweet dot user Now where will user come Because it is not in form But you get user in every request So we have appended user Now i will save this tweet Now when i say tweet save Because i have not given commit false Now in my database Tweet is saved So we can Redirect Is there any redirect No So we will bring redirect We will get redirect in shortcuts Get object 404 And here is our redirect Now redirect is here Here it is Where you want to redirect It is totally up to you You can redirect on tweet list We redirect on tweet list It is very simple I can use it here Redirect I don't like it But you have to give it in strings Tweet list Apart from personal opinion You must have understood How to handle forms You can use jango forms Or you can use your customised forms Mostly major major work is this So our tweet is also created Now how to edit tweet This is also an interesting case Because in jango You can use same tweet form To edit Let's do it Let's define a method And call it tweet underscore edit Same work Request All right Now you know What to do Basic work is If And You have Else case In else case You are giving a simple form How did you get this form We got it From tweet form Now we have to pass something In this Instance equals to tweet I don't have this tweet I don't have this tweet So obviously I will get this tweet Now we declare a variable We will discuss it later Now we will empty it We have added tweet form Because We have data Because we have edit functionality So we want to prefill So we need some data Because we are editing So we are adding this This work is done Now We have no difference Between this and other Here And indent it So we returned Render, request And used same tweet form And sent data This work is done But now how to edit While editing You need data You can't edit all tweets You will get some data So the easiest way Is to use get object and 404 Either you will get object or 404 We will pass 2-3 parameters First is tweet Where did this tweet come from Let's take it in capital So you will get this Request and parameters Which we will call Tweet underscore ID You can call it ID Tweet ID Now in get 404 First parameter is Tweet This is model Which model should i see But which Primary key So in that primary key You can pass Tweet ID So we call it Tweet underscore ID Here i am saying Tweet underscore ID So remember In url also You have to write Tweet underscore ID Or PK underscore ID So you have to say same in url Standard 101 But not only this We want to give one more thing User can edit any tweet But i don't want Edit form is available for all If it is your tweet Then we can give one more parameter You can find it But you can also add User should be Request dot user So we will keep it And We got one tweet Now We have tweet Now we come to condition Now we say request dot Same method If we have method Post Then we want to do all If request dot method You have post Then we have to do You can copy paste Exactly Form But One more thing You have to remember When you are giving edit tweet You have to use instance Instance Because If you don't give Then you will feel You are editing old tweet So this form is designed Now You know I have Instance of tweet I have already taken I have to save it To save It is same Almost same That's why people Develop in jango Now you know Form dot is valid You will take Now you know I will save it But commit false Form dot save And commit False Because i have to add user So here is tweet But we will keep standard You can ignore it Now you can understand We have saved user Now i can save Here is tweet Now Redirect And redirect To tweet list Tweet underscore list Now you can edit Tweet And create And list Now delete tweet Delete So Tweet underscore delete Same thing Now You can edit I want id Delete I want id Tweet underscore id Same Now same standard work No When you delete You can give button But button Perform activity You want activity You can use Post method We have to know Tweet Get object And pass data In tweet model And pass on Primary key And user User equals Request dot user Now Hold it Now You can see Post method If Request dot Method If Post We have to do Here You can see Valid You can see But Check form Now Tweet dot delete Delete Now Redirect Return Redirect Redirect Tweet underscore list Here When you done Delete But If method Not done Confirm Where it will be You have to render Form Templating language Use it Here If method Not done When you send post request Before that Display Here Before that Display Here Same Delete Before that Render You can do Direct Template Tweet Confirm Underscore Here No need to send form But Tweet Tweet Tweet Tweet Tweet Tweet Tweet Tweet Tweet Tweet Tweet Now How to do Crud operation How to fetch data Jango Is easy SQL Get object 404 How to request Mostly .object All All All How to do How to fetch All All All How to do How to fetch All All All All All All All Don't expect that the application will run directly. I think only a newbie will do this. That our application runs at once. No one can do it. Everyone has to debug. We will do it. You can do it too. So let's start now. And ginger templates, by the way, comment target, etc. You must have completed it. You must have subscribed to the channel. And from now on, you will not make so much pressure that when is the video coming? We take time. We work a little slowly. But we do the best work. We just have to close our eyes and make content. So it takes time. Try to understand. You support us so much. Do a little more. Let's share the screen with you. Now let's close all of them first. Because all their work is done. Almost done. Now we open the templates. And let's keep the views open. Because it will also need what we have to create. So I don't think we have to do index.html. Because we have it. Next we need tweetlist.html. Let's copy it. And make a new file. New file in templates. And here is tweetlist.html. Now the tweetlist.html file It doesn't have much work. You don't have to worry about it. What do we do once? We make all the files. Because there is not much. We also need tweetform.html. Let's copy it. And new file. What else do we need? We are using the same form in edit. We will use the same form. And in confirm delete. Let's copy it. And new file in templates. Here is the paste. So this is our work. Now let's take the basic html. Let's copy and paste it in all. Here is the paste. And here is the paste. So one work is done. That's it. Now let's start with the tweetlist. How to make tweets list. Now There is not much work to make a tweet list. It's very basic. First of all, We are using bootstrap. Before coming to the end block. Let's give a button here. So that the user can create a tweet. Let's give a button. Where will this button go? Let's use Django templates. So that it is easy to go. So this is done. Now let's give a URL here. Where will the URL go? tweet underscore create This is a good thing about templates. That this work is done easily. We have given the reference here. Now we have to write something in this tweet. So let's write. Create New tweet. Let's write create a tweet. It will be better for you. Now because this is a simple a tag. Let's give a class. Bootstrap class is btn-primary This work is done. Now let's make a row. div.container.row A row of bootstrap is created. Let's give a gap-3. So that there is a gap in every card. Now we need a loop. So let's write a for loop. So from which loop do we have to get? for tweet in tweets Because if you remember here. In the views, all the listings we had. That was tweets. And we were sending these tweets. So we are looping on these tweets. Now let's do the work. Now let's come here. What do you have to loop? What do you have to repeat? For that, the easiest thing is to go to bootstrap. Let's go to docs and pick up a card from here. It will be a little easy to work. Let's pick up this first card. And let's paste it. Now we know that the whole card will be repeated. So we just have to inject data. So to inject data, first of all. We have to inject image. So here we can inject image in the source. So here we have injected the template. Now we know that we have called a single object tweet. And we have called it a photo in the database. But it does not come only from the photo. We also have to give the URL. So we have a photo here. The title of the card. If you want, you can give the text of the card tweet. Whatever you want. And here we give the username. It's on us. So we give the username. Now we put the tweet in the text. Now it's just an injection. Here we give the tweet. Text. So this is the tweet text. And this is all done. Now you can see that we also have a button. Which is called go somewhere. So we will do the same thing. But btn is primary. So we make it an edit button. And this is the delete button. It's a simple thing. Let's write edit. But this URL will go somewhere. We can't write it like this. So we do the same thing. Here we have started the templating. And we have called it URL. Where will the URL go? It will go to edit tweet. Tweet underscore edit. So this is our edit. But we can't just edit it alone. We have to send the URL too. Because you know that every tweet is being repeated. We have access to the primary key. So you can send more data on any views. Now we have to send tweet dot id. So we send the id. Now we have the edit button. Similarly we make a delete button. Here we have delete. And we give it btn danger. So that the button looks red. Now where will this URL go? It will go to tweet underscore delete. And you will need the tweet id there too. And I think that's it. Let's run it once. It is still running. So we come here. And obviously we have not kept anything on the homepage. So let's come to tweet. And let's reload it. So I think we have a tweet. Let's go to admin. And refresh it. We have a tweet but it is not showing. Because we have not given the URL. Because we have not given the URL. That's why it is not showing. So let's test it. Let's give the URL too. It is not a big deal to give the URL. Let's discuss it one by one. So where do we want to show the listing? Actually what we will do is we will list all the tweets on the homepage. So instead of index you can shift it somewhere else. We will edit the list of tweets here. And let's list the name too. Tweet underscore list. So hopefully now we should have a better URL. Let's refresh it. And here slash tweet tweet create not found. Tweet create is not a valid. Tweet create. Oh, because we don't have that URL. So we will have to give the URL of tweet create. Alright. Let's give that too. Tweet create. Because we have to give both create and delete. Tweet create. Because if we don't have both of them then we will have an issue because the template is loading them. Tweet create and delete too. We have edit too. I think we are giving create and delete all. So let's write all of them one by one. First create and then edit. Tweet edit. And let's change these too. This is create. And this is edit. Because everything is loading in the first template. So we have to do the URL work. And this is tweet underscore delete. Now let's go to their views one by one. I will list them all on the homepage. And this is create. I don't need any ID while creating. So this much work is done. Now let's take it to the next line. It will look easy. And when I am doing edit here then I will need an ID. So whenever you take an ID, first this angular bracket or diamond bracket. I will get an ID in integer format. And I am calling this tweet underscore ID. It is important to say tweet underscore ID because it is written in the views too. After that I will mention an URL here. We have got the tweet ID like this. Outside of that, slash edit slash. So here I will get the tweet ID and it will populate in the view. This syntax automatically pass on the views. So let's copy this. And we have to do the same in delete too. So here we come to slash delete slash. So hopefully we have got the delete work done. So hopefully when we save this and refresh it. Yes, we have got it. So let's modify it a little. I am not going to do CSS. This is for you. So in the button, margin bottom 4. I think 4 will be fine. So we have got the create tweet now. And we have got the edit button and the delete button too. For now it is working. But if I go to the edit button, nothing is happening because I have not set the template of the edit button. So I think the template of create is done. We have got it set. Now let's do the create. So let's confirm. No, we have to create. So let's discuss on the form how we can create the form. Now see, it is very easy to take the form. First we need a small text in the content that instead of welcome to chai jango we want to write let's leave h1 here. Let's declare h2 here. Now I want text in h2. Now the problem is what should be the text? Edit tweet or create new tweet? So there is a simple way to use the templating of jango. Here we have put the templating. Now we will ask if form .instance.pk .instance.pk is the instance of the primary key id. So what we will do is we will write here edit tweet. Because in this case you have come to edit the tweet. And we will also use else case. Here we have else. If it is not then we will give create tweet. And after this we will have to end the whole block. So this is our end if. End if. Here we have. I think we can do it a little better. Here we have. It will be easier for you to understand what we are doing here. Now I am used to seeing like this. So here we have said that we will write edit tweet. If form is of instance. Means form is here to be edited. This is the way to see it. And else we will write create tweet. So at least if we do this much, we will know that if we click on create tweet, then here create tweet is coming. For now, the work will be done. Now you have to make the form. This is the most interesting thing here. Making form is very easy. So here we have made a form. We need form of post method. We don't need action. Yes, this is also a good thing in Django. One thing we want to do here is to give encryption type. Enc type. We are giving this enc type because the form we have is accepting images also. This is HTML 101. So we will call this multipart form. form-data So now our form will accept images or any file. This is basic HTML 101. So this is the form. Let's add a class here. It will look good. We will not do much now. Let's make form. Now how to make form? Take two template strings. And write form. This much work will be done. You can also write .asp. This will render as a paragraph. You can also write form directly. Let's show you both. Refresh. Although it doesn't look good. You will have to add more CSS. We are not doing it now. But we are seeing how powerful Django is that I didn't have to make form. I have text and photo. If you didn't give it as a p then also we would have rendered. There is no problem. We like to render it as a paragraph. Now let's see what mistakes we make. We create a button. And type btn.btn-warning There is no warning. It's just a simple form. Button will be orange. You don't have to type submit. Because there is only one button. So it will automatically submit. But we will type submit. And also call it submit. You can also write new tweet. As you like. If you want to go back then you can also add a tag. Which is simple. You can also tell where you want to go. Here we write url. And send it back. On tweet underscore list. And say back to tweet list. Here it is. Let's refresh it. Here it is. We have tweet, submit and back to tweet list. Let's shift it a little. So this is it. Now this form will not be submitted. Why? Because let's say I write tweet from front end. And let's choose a photo. Tech exploration. And submit it. You will see csrf verification failed. So this code is because of that. We said in views that jango does it but still form should be valid. So in this case, whenever you submit a form jango has a compulsory that you have to inject csrf security. We do it too. It's very easy. csrf token. We have csrf token. So this csrf token will do all the work. What happens with this csrf token Let's go back. You can refresh it. Right click, inspect. And You can see the input. It's automatically hidden. And this csrf middleware token is an application that is by default in jango. And whenever you refresh it, the value will change automatically. And it's already connected to your backend. So you don't have to do all the work. Whenever you refresh, a new value will come. Like a paragraph, your form is here. If you want to do something like CSS, you can do it easily. You have an easy text area. You don't have to do dashlane. These are my plugins. So basically it can be edited or modified. Let's check it. This is tweet from frontend with chai. It will be with chai. It's going to be morning. Let's submit it. It's submitted. We have a new tweet. It's easy. Now let's go to edit. As soon as we go to edit, we don't have to do anything. Everything was already written on the backend. We have the same edit tweet. This tweet is from frontend with chai. You have the photo. You can change it or clear it. You can also submit it. This tweet is frontend from chai with edit feature. Obviously, we have the word blocking. We have submitted it. We don't have to do anything. We have to do it on delete. Because the confirmation form of delete is still empty. There is nothing much in it. Let me tell you. Let's go here. Let's change the text. Are you sure? That you want to delete the tweet. This work is done. Now we need a form. It should be of post type. We don't need a multi part here. Because we are not sending any data. So we don't need a multi part. We are getting a form data. But what is the most important thing? Let's do the regular work first. Let's do the button. Let's put the class. btn-danger Let's call it delete. This button will come. When the button is here, someone may want to cancel it. Let's put an aref here. Let's call it tweet list. tweet underscore list. The user will go back. Let's call it cancel. Let's add classes. It's not expensive. btn-success It will look good. Now if you delete it, you have a delete option. Delete option is cancelled. But it will not be deleted. Because as soon as you delete it, the same csrf verification field will be there. And it should be. Because it is also going into the database. But if you know why it is coming, then you can simply inject a csrf in that form. Here is the csrf token. Now you are here. Now let's come back. Let's refresh. Let's delete the first tweet. And let's call it delete. The problem is that I did this tweet. That's why I'm able to delete it. Let's do this much in this section. We have some work left. But I think you have understood that the whole functionality whether you call it twitter or instagram it's a matter of layout. Whether you want to give it a layout like twitter or any other layout. We have edited it on big buttons. You could have edited it on a pencil icon. It was a very basic task. So let's do this much in this section. Take care of the comment section. And see you in the next segment. So now let's talk about protection. How can you protect your URLs, views, and all. And how can you do custom user registration. Although the custom user authentication of Django which is already given by the user table can be modified in many ways. Some people don't like to use it. They link it to a further table. That is also good. But it depends on your use case. But at least in this segment you will get a very good basic idea how to handle those tables. Because Django's inbuilt user registration is very powerful. It is much better to use it. But it has a small drawback that it takes everything on the user name and not on the email. You can add that field. It's not a big deal. So let's see how to protect the route. The video can be a little lengthy because we will discuss a lot of things. But it's okay. We will discuss it with tea. First of all I am able to create and see all the tweets. But as soon as I copy it and go to incognito mode I am able to create tweets here as well. But there will be no user. There will be an issue. If I select test and choose a file as soon as I submit it there will be issues because there are no auth, models and users. These URLs and anonymous pages can be improved. We can give more responses. But the thing is users are needed. These messages can be made better. But now it's time to give protection to the user. So that you can't click on the creed. So let's define it. First of all, we come to our views. Let's remove everything else. We don't need this. And we don't need these templates. Now I want to keep this as it is. Do you want to protect the tweet list? No, I don't want to do this. Because it is kept by itself. It's okay if everyone can see the tweets. But I want to protect the creation part. So how can we do it in a standard way? You also have decorators in Django. So from Django.contrib You get all the work in the auth-related contrib. And here you get one thing which is very powerful. Decorators. I have taught decorators in my python series. And those who have understood the example, they must have understood that it is a very easy job. If you want to protect the creator, then you have to do a decorator on it. Which wraps the function with any functionality. So I said login created. Now it's your turn. I want to protect the edit. So I put it on it. And I write here at login required. That's it. I said that in Django, when things are easy, then it is very easy. Once you know that it is easy, then what to say. So now as soon as I save it, I wrote this code. Let's refresh it. Let's copy it. Now at least it is protected. If I do create new tweet, then it says that you can't do it. We also have a very interesting URL. Which says accounts slash login. We don't have a defined route yet. And it also takes care of next. Where do you want to take next after login. So a lot of work has been done. But obviously it is not complete. But progress is progress. So let's go. Now we have done this work. Now we need some user registration and all this. So let's use forms of Django. And get user registration. So we come to forms.py. And do it here. Some people want to keep it separate. But usually it is kept here. So we define a simple class. Which is called user registration form. User registration form. Now this form, because it is not a common form. This form which we want to use is Django's inbuilt form. Because Django also gives you the same form during admin. And Django has its own models. So through those models only you get an inbuilt form. How many fields you have to activate from those forms, you tell. Again the same thing. You will get auth in contrib. So django.contrib You will get auth in it. Now from this auth I want to get forms. And from here you import a user creation form. You get it in user change form. Now you have got the user creation form. So use it. Now you have got the user creation form. You take it here. Now it depends on you what other fields you want to add in this form. It is up to you. I will add an email field here. So how will we get email? Same forms. And you take an email field. If you want to give more fields, you can take that too. Rest is the same class. Meta class is created here. You have to mention fields in it. Any suggestions? No. Okay. Now these fields are tuple. Now in this you have to see what you want. Oh, we forgot to define the model. Here the model was tweet. So here the model will also be user. So the model we want is user. Now we don't have a user. So we will get the user. So in contrib, in auth, we don't need a form. We need models. And which model will come from here? User. Now which fields do you want to keep? Tell us in tuple. Now the interesting thing is that we gave an array here. Here we have to give tuple because here we are using built-in forms. We are using the built-in table. Here we have made it. Now you can see. Here you have taken the username. Now you have to give the email. And one interesting thing in Django is the passwords. Whenever you take from the user, you have to give password1 and password2. This is also modifiable. But yes, in this way you have fields that all the inbuilt security features of Django are attached to both the passwords. Okay. Now we have the form. Now let's go to our views. What do we have to do with views? Now I want a view where the user can register. If he couldn't register, then what is the benefit of it? So let's make a view. So let's call it a simple register. This is the view of the register. Here is the request. We will not give any suggestion. Okay, don't give. So we have the register Now what do we want? The work is going to be exactly the same. But you have to take care of a few things. First of all, where are the default templates kept? Whenever you tease this kind of default Django, then actually what is expected from you that where will you keep the login form, registration form, you will keep it in the outer templates. Because the app is centric. The job of the app is not authentication. This is the job of the whole Django. So you make a special folder in the templates and then you put the registration. Here it is expected that all the work will be done. And there are 2-3 files in the registration. Let's make it now. So let's make a new file. These are the expected files. register.html Here we will hand over all the views of your registration. One of us will have login.html And one is expected from you that you will keep it here. Now we are customizing it. So we are keeping it as logged out. By the way, everything is on documentation. I am not saying anything in the air. Everyone is teaching from there. So this is our register route. Now what to do? Keep the same files. And then what to do? Keep the URL page html under return. All the work is the same. Let's copy it from here and paste it as it is. Now I have a request. And the form is not here. I need it in the registration. register.html Here you have given the form. Along with it, you have to give a form. We will make it now. We will make it soon. And here we remove it. And here is the form. So this is the work of our form. Now let's take an if-else. Here we have to see method post request or give it a regular form. So let's take an if. And pass. And let's take an else. And in the else case, you will get a form. User registration form. Have not imported it? Tweet form. User registration form. Have not created it? User registration form. So user registration form is here. And now user registration form. Here is your form. Now in the if case, we have to make a form. If else, the form is going to the user. So in the if case, we give method request post. request. method post. So what we will do is, let's remove this pass. Now we have to make a form. How will the form be made? But this time, request.post And let's make it. Here is the form object. Ok. So when we did it above, it was almost the same. We had the same form. We had the same tweet form. request.post. And request.files. Now we have to make a form. So we have made a form instance. It is the same thing. Now we will check again. Is the form valid or not? It is always standardized. form. is valid. If the form is valid, then we will make the form user. Now here are a few interesting things. You can save the user directly. There is no issue. But we will take the user. I will tell you a few things. So that it will be useful for you in the future. And we will do the same commit. That the form is not saved yet. So here you can check the password. And you can also take the cleaned data from the form. Sometimes, read this clean data. It also gives stripping. It also gives cleansing. It also gives cleaning. It does a lot of things. So we do this. You are given a method called .setpassword. Because it is inbuilt in Django. You can set the password here. And the easiest thing is to pick up the data from the form. So from the form, whenever you want to pick up the data, you get a method called cleaned data. This is a very interesting method. So what you will do is, whatever field you want, you pass it in the string and pick up the name. I will pick up password1 for now. Because I am going to use Django's form. So I got password1 and password2. And if you don't remember, then it is here. You can pick up the password1, password2, email, username. Whatever field you want to do further with it. So this is how data is picked up through the user form. Here we have used the set password method. But this process is the same. You have to manipulate. You have to create a new user. You have to create a new username. You can do all that. After that, we have saved the user. Now what I want is, after the user is saved, the login is also done. So I don't have to do anything. I can use the login directly. Now you will ask how to login. You have to bring the login. It will come from Django contrib. So we bring it. Django contrib gives you methods. We import it directly from the login. Because you have the data. So you can import the login. And you can pass the entire login functionality in Django. Because user registration is the problem. The same thing will remain for the login. So just come here and give the login. We will pass the user in the login. Because we have the user now. So we have to give the request. And here we have passed the user. So the login will be done automatically. If you don't want to redirect, then you can do it. Now we do here, return and redirect. And where will we redirect it? Tweet underscore list. This is on you how you design feature functionality. So much work is done. But this will not work. Now next you know, we will go to urls.py. This work is done. Now take it to the URL. We do one thing. Let's duplicate it. And let's run a full registration from here. Go to register slash. There we will give you a views. Views dot register. Here it is. And change the name of it. We give you register. Will this work? This is a very interesting thing. Let's do it. Now we come and copy it. And open it in incognito mode. So now we should not work. But as soon as I create a tweet, now a little issue came. URL configured in urls.django.tried.these.parameter Django does not know that there is a URL in the name of register. Because where is it going? It is going to account slash login. So this is the configuration of Django. That there is a little issue in Django settings. So we have to handle it. Now if you know that Django settings is giving some issue or something like this. So we have to define it completely. Where are the URLs coming? How is all this work coming? So what to do for that? Let's go to the head queue. And go to settings.py. Here you have to manually define where the URLs are coming. Where is the login redirect? Where is the logout redirect? You can change them manually. So one of the most common is login underscore URL. Where is our login URL? So what we will do is go to slash accounts slash login. Okay, we said that this is our login URL. Now this is the login URL. If you want, you can define logout URL and other URLs in the same way. So what we do is login underscore redirect underscore URL. Now we have said redirect. So where do we redirect? So we say that you go to tweet. Sorry, we have not put chai. We have put tweet. So you go to tweet. Similarly, we do the same for logout URL. So you go to tweet. Now we know that this is login URL. But where will it redirect? So this is login redirect. Now we will do logout redirect. So that the error page is not visible after logout. So here you have redirected. So what happened here is we have redirected the existing login URL to the redirect URL. And we have enabled the configuration of account slash login. Now we have redirected it to slash tweet. Now let's see what problems we face. So let's copy it again. Let's go to incognito mode and paste it. Now let's see what issues we face. So let's create a tweet. Now because I am not logged in, but we are facing this issue. This is also a very interesting issue. Let's solve this too. Now a small issue is coming here. We have told the settings that it is fine to be like this. But it does not know that account slash login or slash accounts is also a thing. Because if we go there, we can redirect the login. So obviously, it makes sense that something is happening in the URL. It is absolutely true that you have not been able to configure the URL properly yet. Now let's configure that too. Now there is not much in this. You have to do a few things here. Whenever you change it like this, you can see where it is and how it will be. So the first thing is that we copy it. And the first modification will be in the accounts. And in the accounts, we will include and we will not tweet. Here I have to give the contrib of Django. And I don't like this much. So I always write a small statement here. Django.contrib Because I get suggestions here. Django.contrib.auth So we need this and we get the URLs from it. Like this. So we will copy it from here. And here we will paste it. And we didn't need this anyway. Did we need it? Now we can do one more thing with it. Import A small setting is happening. Views as auth underscore views Ok. These are the views. It shouldn't clash with our views. So you will see it like this. Ok. We have done one thing. Now we will see why we have imported it. We will see it now. For now, we will save it and see if our problem is solved. So we go back and refresh it. And we will create tweet. So now we have the accounts login and create. At least it is an improvement. We won't say 100% that it is done. But at least it is an improvement. Now you might have understood why we have this problem. Because the register.html we don't have anything here. If we had something in register.html then it would have been useful. So let's do one thing. Let's write a test here. Test register. Is this the problem? Let's go back and refresh it. Create tweet. This is not of register. Let's try it on login. Test login. Save it. Go back and refresh it. Yes. So at least we know how the whole URL redirect scheme is working. The whole flow is in our control. So what should we do now? Let's do all the work of register and login. So first of all extend layout.html. And then create an unnamed blog. Let's name it content. Here we go. And here we need a form. We need a post form. No need for action. And here is the form. You already know in the form. You might have understood by now that CSRF token is needed. So here is the CSRF token. After that we need to render the form. So form.as underscore p. Here we go. Now let's add a submit button. button btn dot btn dash primary and let's call it register. So this is the work of one form. Let's copy it. Oh! I should have made register form. No problem. Login form will be made in the same way. So here is the register form. Now we need to modify login a little bit. Let's write h2 because I don't know which form it is. login form. And let's write register form. Here we go. That's it. Now we need to redirect the login form. If the login form doesn't have the url, then we need to redirect it. It looks like this. Don't have an account? So please login. Register here. And in this here we go. Redact the url. Nothing else. Now the register url is there. So the register will be done. That's it. You can do the same on the login page. Sorry, on the register page. If you have an account, then login. You can do this. Locked out is also important. We should have a locked out account. Nothing much. Let's give a basic content. Copy and paste. So that there is no error. Extend layout, block content. Let's call it logged out. Logged out. Here we don't need anything else. You have been logged out. And we don't need the form. Ok. Let's change this. You have been logged out. And let's call it login again. Login here. And change the url. Here it is. Hopefully, we should have done a lot of work. Let's refresh the page. Now we have a login form, username password, register form, email, password, password confirmation. See, we write password 2 and it is confirmed. So we have done a lot of work. Now one more small work. A lot of work is left. Let's register a new user. And virat. Ok. virat at chai.com And enter the password. Password security will be the same as it was earlier. Let's register. Now we come to create tweet. So here it is. And add a photo. This photo is good. Submit. Now the problem is that virat has tweeted. Everyone can see the edit button. Virat edits Hitesh's tweets too. But he shouldn't. But when you go to edit, you get an error that no tweet matches the given query. Because he didn't have the same user. So it's ok. We have the option to edit. Virat can edit his own tweets. But why show it to everyone? So can we modify this a little bit? Show it to the users optionally. So that the card listing is not visible to everyone. It can be done. Let's do it. Now we go to the headquarter. A lot of work is done. Let's close it. Here. Let's close the HQ. Let's close the templates. Let's go to the listing. Now the point is that these two, edit and this need to be rendered conditionally. When we have the user. So what we do is Here. Let's give a small if condition. If tweet dot user. Because the tweet object is already there. The tweets are here. We can check that the user in the tweet is it a user? This is a very interesting thing. You can access this user anywhere in Django templates. Because the user is a part of the request. You can access it anywhere. You can dump this user object and see what information is there. But if we have this option then only we want to show the edit and delete option. It's very easy. It was not that difficult. And if. Let's refresh it. Now I can't see the edit and delete button of Hitesh in Virat's tweet. Only Virat can see his own buttons. Okay. This work is done. Now I have to do more work. Suppose I have to do some modification or something like this. So that can also be done. It's not a big work. I think we can do that. Because we can give the feature of logout here. It will be very good. Let's go now to the templates and to the layout. So in the layout we have this search button. And this is the whole form. This form is not very useful. But it's okay. Maybe you want to enable some search feature. So now we want to give 2-3 buttons to the users. Let's give one button of home so that it can reach the tweet list easily. So let's put classes in the a tag. btn and btn-primary btn and btn-primary btn and btn-primary And let's inject URLs in it. URL Where do you want to go? You want to go to the tweet list. tweet underscore list And we will write tweet home in it. So I think as soon as we refresh, we have tweet home. Let's add more classes. margin x-2 Okay. So now you have tweet home. I think everyone should see tweet home. But only the authenticated users should see the logout button. Otherwise you should see the login and logout button. Okay. So let's inject our simple if-else case. So here it is. So first of all, check if. Now as I told you, you can access the user anywhere. And this user has properties. So this is a famous framework. You don't have to check the authentication. You don't have to inject middleware. underscore is underscore authenticated That's it. Now I will add an else case. So here it is. A small else case. And here it is. And here it is. And if. Okay. Now if the user is authenticated, then he should see the logout button. Now the most interesting thing is logout is not a button. It is a form. It looks like a button, but it is actually a form. So you need a form. Which type? Post type. You don't need action, but you need to give a form. Because this is an issue of authentication. Django takes it very seriously. So first of all, we come to this. Post. Okay. You have given it. Now you have to give action here. Here is the action. In the action, we list the direct URL. Here it is. And where do we have to give the URL? Simple logout. Now we will have a little problem here. We will handle that too, but there is a problem here. Let me tell you first. So this is your form. The first thing you are guessing. Here is the CSRF token. Now you can make a simple button in it. So here is the button. And let's give it a class. Button btn-danger. And where will this button go? Logout. Although one button automatically submits, but still why take the risk? Give one. Type. Submit. Here you go. The problem is that if I refresh it, you have a logout button. Class btn-danger. Refresh. Now you have a logout button. Let's open another incognito mode. Let's copy it. Let's open another one. What money is it taking to open? Here you have tweet, logout. And you also have tweet home. Incognito tweet home. Let's refresh it. Let's logout. Incognito is also carrying on. As soon as you logout, you have a logout. Alright. Nice. I think there should have been an issue, but no. You can create a tweet. You can log in and get this form. Now let's do a few more things. Logout button is done. Similarly, you will need more buttons. Which are A tags. Let's copy tweet home. Else, if you are log in, you will see these buttons. Else, you will see log in and register. Let's call it register. And where will you go? You will go to log in. No, to register. Sorry. Because you are a register. Similarly, you will go to log in. And let's change it. Login. And let's change both of them. Success. URL changes a bit. It looks good. Here is the logout button. Let's copy it. And here we have log in and register button. Now we know that we can register. Let's log in. The most interesting thing is that here is the username. Virat. And password. And as soon as I register, I get a create tweet. Not a home page. This is the best thing about Django. It's good. Tweet home is also working. Logout is also working. Functionality design is not that much. Now, let's do an assignment. You have to define search functionality. Search functionality is nothing. It's just a form. Data will come from this form. You have to search something using Django ORM. Searching will be done on the basis of text of tweet. After that, you have to create a new view. A new view will be created. A new template will be created with it. Results of the search will be created. Do a small exercise. If you need help, come to our discord community. Many people do such assignments. They help each other. You have to implement search functionality. You have to put a search button here. Any tweet that is in search like frontend keyword should be accessed. You will get an easy task. You will do it easily. I think this project was fun for us. We studied about Django's inbuilt models. How can they be manipulated? How can we use Django's inbuilt forms? How can we use its super power? This was a good project for us. We are creating, editing, and rendering things. It was a good project. Now, we have reached this point. We are in-depth about Django. We have done a good project. We have to do further exploration. But now we are in a position that in the coming days or months, whenever we get time, we can make complex projects of Django. We can use our own forms instead of Django's. We can send customized data and design it. We can design it with e-commerce or other applications. We will use it there. It is not like you use bootstrap only. There will be many people. Please tell them. It is not like we have used bootstrap. You can use material. I have told you about tailwind. There are many things you can do in Django. I think this was our final project. We have completed Django. We will end the series with this. But there will be more videos. I will show you some extra or innovative things in Django. You can give suggestions on discord. We will listen to them and do it. We will end the series with this. The more important it is to start a series, the more important it is to end it. So that you know that you can work on it. You have to create a search bar or search form. You have to create a functionality. You need help? You can take it from discord. You will be confident. You know the functionality and features. You know how the framework works and operates. You know where the problems can be. You know how to solve them. You can take help from google, chatgpt, discord. You can take help from google, chatgpt, discord. There is no issue. If you have not subscribed yet, please do it. I enjoyed making this series. You gave me a lot of love. You gave me a lot of support. That is why I was able to do so much. Otherwise, who records the series at 3 or 4 in the night? It's all your love. Thank you so much for that. Keep drinking tea. We will arrange for the code. See you in the next video."}
